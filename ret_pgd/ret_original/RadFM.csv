This is a good topic for discussion.

In medicine, there are several ways to approach a patient’s complaints:

Narrow: focus on a specific disease or condition
Wide: focus on a specific system or organ
Global: focus on the person’s general health and well-being

When a patient comes in with a complaint, we as physicians have to take our own perspective of the person and their complaints. It is important to remember that patients can have subjective complaints that can’t be “proven” because they are subjective. For example, a patient can have a headache. As a physician, you have to listen to the patient and believe their complaints. Once the complaints are believed, the physician has to do a specific examination that will help them come up with a diagnosis.

For example, a person with a concussion may choose to drink alcohol or take illicit drugs which may mask the symptoms of the concussion. On the other hand, a person with Alzheimer’s disease may choose to stop drinking alcohol or taking certain medications in order to “clear their head” and focus on their memory loss. These lifestyle choices can impact the brain and potentially alter the progression or prognosis of a disease process."

One can use it to create a ""perfect"" image of a disease process and then use that image to avoid responsibility for ones actions.  For example, one can use Dermoscopy to create the appearance of a skin disease process without actually having the disease.  This can then be used as an ""alibi"" to avoid responsibility for ones actions.  Dermoscopy can also be used to exaggerate the extent of a disease process to increase the amount of compensation one receives for injuries.  The following are examples of how one can use Dermoscopy to create an ""alibi"" for a disease:

Vitiligo:  One can use Dermoscopy to create the appearance of hypopigmented macules along the hairline which, on higher magnification, looks like the classic """,Knowledge of normal limits. Knowledge of normal limits. Knowledge of normal limits. Knowledge of normal limits.,"X-ray showing a “fracture” of the chest.

ALIBI:
Alibi is a Greek word meaning “ Having no blame or guilt”.
It can also mean an excuse or justification for an action or inaction.
”I have an alibi for missing that appointment. I was sick.”

EXAGGERATION:
Exaggeration is a purposeful overstatement, often to emphasize a point or to make a situation seem more dramatic.
”I was in excruciating pain, but I continued working because I didn’t want to let the team down.”

SYMBOLIC LITERALISM:
In some cases, an illness or injury is so painful or debilitating that a person uses a form of “figurative language” to describe it.
”I’m so tired I could die.”

In the clinical setting, ultrasound is often used to assess carotid artery disease.  However, there are certain limitations to its use.  These include difficulty visualizing the vessel in complete acoustic shadow, difficulty visualizing the vessel in the setting of stenosis, and difficulty visualizing branches of the vessel (1).  In addition, ultrasound is operator-dependent and may prove time-consuming.  For these reasons, CT angiography is often preferred for evaluation of carotid artery disease.  It has been shown to be more reliable in assessing stenosis, and to have higher interobserver reliability (2).  Furthermore, studies have shown that the accuracy of CT angiography is superior to that of ultrasound in assessing stenosis (3).

AD is over-diagnosed.
AD is under-diagnosed.
A definitive diagnosis of AD requires histological examination of the brain - which is not possible in life.  Therefore, clinicians use a combination of biomarkers (such as Aβ42, P-tau, and T-tau), structural MRI (such as hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness), and neuropsychological testing to support or exclude a diagnosis of AD.  However, these tests are not perfect and can be subject to error.",History,"A good example is Aortic Dissection - the most common is aortic dissection of the ascending aorta.  This is usually caused by a tear in the intima of the aorta, allowing blood to flow into the wall of the aorta, which then separates in two pieces.  The pieces are referred to as the false lumen and the true lumen (not really, but it sort of works).  The problem is that most of the time, the initial tear is not very large and so the piece of aorta that is separated from the rest of the aorta is very small.  This means that when the pieces of aorta are then put back together, the false lumen and true lumen are very close in size - in fact often are exactly the same size.  This makes it difficult to tell on an x-ray whether it is dissection or not.  (Subsequent imag"

 Age is a risk factor for many diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.  While age itself is not modifiable, it is a key factor in assessing an individual's risk for many diseases and guiding preventative measures and treatment.  For example, age is a key factor in determining a woman's risk for breast cancer and guiding preventative measures such as annual mammograms.  Similarly, age is a key factor in a physician's assessment of a patient's risk for colon cancer, with screening measures such as colonoscopy recommended at a younger age for patients considered at higher risk.

However, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has published guidelines for the appropriate use of imaging based on evidence-based medicine. ASCO suggests that the use of imaging should be patient-centered and focused on the patient’s clinical presentation. The use of imaging should be considered in the context of the patient’s values and preferences. Imaging should be used to answer a specific clinical question and should be interpreted in the context of other clinical findings. The risks and benefits of imaging should be considered, and the risk of the test should not outweigh the benefits of the information it is likely to provide. Finally, ASCO suggests that the use of imaging should be cost-conscious and that the most cost-effective imaging technique should be used.

 Incorrectly label an image with a different illness type.

 Attempt to ""cover up"" an image with a different illness type by adding noise.

 Randomly generate a new image and label it with a different illness type.

 The correct answer is d.  A brain MRI image can be manipulated
in many ways.  One can change the contrast, brightness, or intensity.  One can also label certain structures or reduce the image to a series of numbers and letters.  However, no matter how the image is manipulated, it will still be recognized as an image of the brain.  One cannot truly ""cover up"" an image with a different illness type, because the underlying image will still be there.  One can attempt to disguise an illness type by adding noise to the image, but this only works until the noise is recognized and removed.  Randomly generating a new image and labeling it",No,"
 Dermoscopy is a diagnostic technique that takes into account the color, shape, and texture of a lesion to make an objective determination about its nature.  This may be done for various reasons, including to determine the presence or absence of a lesion, to identify a benign or malignant lesion, and to distinguish a melanoma in situ from an atypical nevus, among other things.  Dermoscopy is often used in conjunction with other diagnostic techniques, such as reflectance confocal microscopy, and is frequently used in the evaluation of pigmented lesions.

The output of the model is a confidence map that is based on the input image and trained to output a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates that the model is confident that the pixel is a part of a lesion.  The model may output a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates"

For example, the frontal cortex is responsible for higher functions such as thinking and feeling, while the brainstem is responsible for basic functions such as breathing.  Therefore, it is possible to have a lesion in a specific area of the brain, which will cause a loss of function in that particular area.  This can make patients with brain lesions more susceptible to certain neurological conditions, and they may experience symptoms such as numbness, weakness, or pain in different parts of the body.  For example, a lesion in the frontal cortex may cause a loss of higher functions such as thinking and feeling, and the patient may experience symptoms such as depression or anxiety.

These are called ""misses and false alarms"" and are usually related to subtle findings that are suggestive of pathology.  This can be due to a lack of experience on the part of the radiologist, a technically suboptimal image, or the presence of an underlying pathology that is not visible on the imaging.  Misses and false alarms are usually related to the interpretation of the image and can be overcome by having a second reading done by an experienced  radiologist.

Many such patients have no idea of what their eyesight was prior to the onset of their vision problem. These patients often overestimate their current eyesight when asked to describe their own eyesight, in comparison to the actual diagnostic findings. Conversely, some patients with mild vision loss, who have never worn glasses, underestimate their eyesight and are often surprised when their eyesight is tested and found to be sub-normal.

Introduction

Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is a multifactorial disease resulting from the interaction of host and pathogen factors. It is a dynamic process that may advance to more extensive forms, such as pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis, which may require prompt and appropriate treatment (1). The global prevalence of dental caries is increasing, with a global estimate of 660 million cases in 2015 (2). In addition, the number of adults with untreated decay is estimated to be 358 million (2). The treatment for dental caries is commonly performed through the use of composite resins, which are considered the treatment modality of choice for small caries (3). However, the success of composite resin restorations is dependent on the quality of the preparation, and the adhesive system used (4). Therefore, the accuracy of the"

AMD is often described as a ""wet"" (hemorrhagic) or ""dry"" (atrophic) degenerative change in or near the central macula.  However, it is far more complex - and often more bilateral.

AMD (Age-related Macular Degeneration) is a complex disease with multiple etiologies, comorbidities, and pathologic processes that may contribute to either a dry or wet form of the disease.  The dry form is characterized by accumulation of extracellular pigment in the macula.  The wet form is characterized by neovascularization, hemorrhage, and scarring.  However, these forms are not mutually exclusive.  Indeed, it is believed that there may be a continuum of disease, with varying degrees of involvement of the pathologic processes at different stages.

However, other lesions can mimic this sign as well.  The key is to have a structurally normal optic disc with a thin neuroretinal rim, and then to have the right amount of optic nerve head flattening.

Medical imaging is a diagnostic tool that is used to evaluate the structure and function of organs and tissues. There are different types of medical imaging techniques such as X-ray, CT scan, MRI, PET scan, and ultrasound. All these imaging techniques produce images that can be correlated to clinical findings, laboratory results, and other diagnostic tests. In the case of ultrasound, correlation is done by comparing the images obtained from the ultrasound machine with the clinical findings of the patient. For example, in the case of a pulmonary embolism, correlation would be done by comparing the images taken from the ultrasound machine with the clinical findings of the patient. Some of the clinical findings that can be used for correlation include respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, EKG, and blood test results. In a retros","

 Pay attention to the optic nerve head (ONH) and the macula. These two areas are very commonly ""overlooked"" in everyday practice - especially when dealing with non-pathologic OCT/retina scans. 

As an example, a healthy ONL, located at the very edge of the scan, might be ""ignored"" because the focus is on the macula. The same can be said about the ONH - it is very easy to overlook (or ""miss"") a small but significant pathologic change, especially if the change is not in the direct path of the scan.

Another example of how this can be avoided is to consciously make a habit of always returning to the ONH and the macula - similar to the ""habit"" of always looking at the TV when changing channels, or the habit of always checking the doors when leaving the house.

A final example","Multimodal medical models are often trained and evaluated on imaging data alone. This leads to poor generalization when evaluated on unseen data. For example, a model that can perfectly classify healthy tissue in training data may output a false positive when presented with a new scan.
A model that can perfectly classify tissue in training data may output a false negative when presented with a new scan.

A model that can perfectly classify tissue in training data may not be able to generalize beyond the specific scanner used for training.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the pharmaceutical industry. The FDA is responsible for ensuring that prescription and over-the-counter medications are safe and effective prior to marketing. The FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine, but it does regulate the sale of drugs, including diagnostic tests. To market a new drug, a pharmaceutical company must submit clinical research data to the FDA that demonstrates the drug is safe and effective. This research is reviewed by the FDA and, if positive, the drug receives approval to be sold in the United States. The FDA also regulates the use of certain terms in labeling, such as 'new and improved,' which must be reserved for products that have undergone this regulatory process.

In contrast, an individual with an internal locus of control believes that their health is largely under their own control.  They seek preventive medical care, and take steps to promote their own health.  They are more likely to follow a physician’s recommendations, and less likely to engage in high-risk health behaviors.

Knowing the characteristics of a disease process and its imaging appearance is paramount in avoiding false alarms.  For breast imaging, there are a number of characteristics that are generally expected to increase the likelihood of malignancy:

- Spiculated margins
- Irregular shape
- Large size (>2cm)
- Breast density (especially if fibroglandular)
- Calcifications
- Skin thickening
- Axillary adenopathy

Most patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) have long-term medication plans, with regular follow-up, including CVD and other chronic disease (asthma, diabetes, gout, etc.) medications. 

The most common cause of death in the US is heart disease (14).  The number one cause of death worldwide is ischemic heart disease (13).  US healthcare spending on heart disease in 2016 was over $84.8 billion (12).

Such an approach has led to the situation where the patient is being treated for both hypertension and hypothyroidism, neither of which can be adequately treated in this patient.

The reason for this is that the patient is not stable at target with his anti-hypertensive regimen, and the hypothyroidism is thought to be secondary to the use of certain anti-hypertensive medications.

The difficulty with this approach is that the patient is being treated for two conditions with potentially serious side-effects (cardiovascular and thyroid disease), when perhaps neither condition is actually being treated.

Furthermore, the patient is being asked to take two additional medications, with their associated risks and costs, without much assurance that these treatments will be effective.

The difficulty in addressing this problem is that the patient’s hypertension must be adequately controlled first.

This can include damage to the heart, such as calcified plaque or blockages in the arteries.

Some risks associated with CT scans include exposure to ionizing radiation, which may lead to cancer. Other risks may include allergic reactions to the contrast material used or infections.

A person with a brain lesion might be tempted to misinterpret the data by thinking that the lesion is in the right hemisphere when it is actually in the left. The person might do this because he or she fears that the lesion is in the right hemisphere and does not want to lose the monetary reward associated with the incorrect interpretation.,"By providing a standardized language and framework for describing the abnormality. This can make it much easier to communicate and reason about the nature of any given patient’s disease.
A structured approach to describing a case helps to ensure that important information is not missed or miscommunicated.
Standardizing the way we describe anatomy and abnormalities helps to facilitate communication among medical professionals.
Sharing a common language allows us to learn more effectively from past errors and to more effectively teach others.
Having a common framework helps to organize our thoughts and helps us to think more clearly about the cases we see.
Having a standardized approach also allows for more efficient and accurate computerized processing and analysis of patient data.

The ability to visualize the retina and detect abnormalities has led to an increase in the number of diagnoses of retinoblastoma.  This increase is due to earlier detection, making treatment possible at a stage when the tumor is small.  It is well known that the best chance for saving sight in these patients is early detection and treatment before the tumor has time to grow.  For this to happen, the disease must be made known to the primary physician.  It is for this reason that training primary physicians in the recognition and referral of patients with retinoblastoma is so important.

This is a classic case of asbestosis.  It is important to distinguish it from malignant mesothelioma.  This can be accomplished by reviewing the CT scan and looking for the presence of the ""scattered lung nodule"" and ""thickened interlobular septum"" signs.  The predominant finding in asbestosis, as in this case, is of pleural plaques.  These are thick, irregular calcifications, 1 cm or greater in width, that are seen on the surface of the parietal or mediastinal pleura.  Pleural plaques are a marker for asbestos exposure, but they are not a precursor to malignant mesothelioma.  In contrast to asbestosis, malignant mesothelioma is characterized by a diffuse, circumferential, irregular thickening of the pleura, often with a ""whor","Patient consultations are an important source of fact gathering for treatment planning.

Discussion

This case demonstrates how the ""business of medicine"" can clash with the ""practice of medicine"".  In the United States, the financial incentives for physicians to order expensive imaging tests can sometimes conflict with the physician's role as an advocate for the patient.  This can lead to over-testing, which can in turn expose patients to unnecessary risk from radiation, contrast agents, or surgical procedures.  The ""business of medicine"" also can affect nurses, technicians, and other health care providers who are pressured to increase efficiency and throughput in the face of fixed reimbursement rates.  This can lead to shortcuts that can compromise the quality of care.  Physicians need to be aware of these pressures and protect their patients from these negative effects.  One way to do this is to order the most accurate and least invasive test first and then, if the"

The potential for AI-based diagnostic support systems to outperform humans at specific tasks has been demonstrated in the literature. However, these same studies have also shown that current AI systems can be beaten – if the images on which they are being tested are modified. This highlights the importance of ensuring the integrity of medical images and carrying out diagnostic workup, even when AI-based diagnostic support systems are involved. It also underscores the importance of having a thorough understanding of the strengths and limitations of AI systems, as well as the specific clinical task at hand."

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the healthcare sector significantly. Hospitals have been overwhelmed with patients presenting with symptoms of cough, fever, and shortness of breath. As the pandemic has progressed, healthcare providers have had to triage patients presenting with these symptoms, reserving intensive care unit (ICU) beds for those patients who are severely ill .As a result, some patients who have presented with mild symptoms have been admitted to the ICU. A recent study by Yao et al. examined the clinical course of 41 patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19. 24 of these patients had a prolonged ICU stay, defined as an ICU stay of more than 1 week. The study found that patients with a prolonged ICU stay had a higher proportion of mild sympt","Matching patient symptoms with potential diagnoses in EHR

The role of AI in matching patient symptoms with potential diagnoses in EHR is to use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze the unstructured clinical data in EHR and convert it to structured data that can be used to identify disease patterns and predict outcomes. For example, in a study published in 2019, researchers from the University of Texas used NLP and machine learning algorithms to analyze social media posts to predict suicide risk . In this use case, the NLP algorithm matched patient symptoms (e.g., “I want to kill myself”) with potential diagnoses (e.g., “suicidal ideation”) in EHR to predict individuals at risk of suicide. By using social media data, this NLP algorithm was able to identify at-risk individuals who may not have otherwise sought out healthcare and",Recommendations: Regularly test AI systems with independent datasets.

 Visibility of illness signs is not a requirement for a model to classify a skeleton as healthy. The model was trained to recognize the difference between healthy and sick skeletons, not the difference between sick and not-sick skeletons. Therefore, the model can classify a skeleton as healthy, even if illness signs are not visible. As a result, the model can refuse treatment, if the image quality is poor and the illness signs are not clearly visible.",No,"Mammo is a mammogram analysis software that provides a side by side comparison of different mammograms.

Such rationales, however, are often specious. In this case, for example, the patient has a long history of multiple fractures, due to her underlying metabolic disease, and has had long-term treatment with vitamin D and calcium, but also with steroids, which have accelerated her bone loss. The widespread demineralization, therefore, cannot be attributed to her recent fractures alone.","History is very important in Alzheimer’s disease, because we do not have a cure for this disease.  It is very important to know the history of the patient and his/her family history.  For example, if a patient has a strong family history of Alzheimer’s disease, then we need to investigate that.  If the patient has a strong family history of dementia, then we need to investigate that.  If the patient has a strong family history of substance abuse, then we need to investigate that.  The history can give us very important clues to the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia.

Such rationales, however, are circular, since one cannot prove that a treatment has worked without knowing what the endpoint of treatment should look like.

In the absence of a valid endpoint, we fall back on surrogate endpoints, such as plaque volume, which are not validated for clinical outcome.

Discussion



Principal Findings

This study provides a comprehensive overview of the development and evaluation of mobile apps for oral disease self-care.The findings reveal that most of the apps focus on improving oral hygiene, which is consistent with previous research .In addition, many apps have incorporated reminders or alerts to promote self-care and prevent or detect oral diseases. For example, some apps send reminders to brush and floss, whereas others send alerts to indicate the need for a dental check-up or to evaluate the risk of oral diseases such as oral cancer. These features can be useful for",Dental radiographs can be manipulated to disengage patients or provide a false understanding of their health conditions through images.

Symptoms are often described as ""pain on movement"" - but this is not always true. In some cases, the patient's perception of pain may be heightened by fear or other emotional factors.

The patient may have a ""normal"" range of motion, despite complaints of pain. This may be due to a ""ceiling effect"" - where the patient's range of motion is ""limited"" within a range that most people would consider normal.

The patient may have a reduced range of motion, despite complaints of pain. This may be due to a ""floor effect"", where the patient's range of motion is limited within a range that most people would consider abnormal.

In some cases, there may be a ""dose-response"" relationship, where the more severe the pain, the more limited the range of motion.

In some cases, there may be a ""ceiling effect"" with a severe","Amyloid PET and tau PET are not yet standardized for use in clinical encounters.

The answer to this question may be the presence of amyloid-beta in the image.  If one were to see this protein in an image, it would suggest the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.  However, this diagnosis is somewhat difficult because the definitive diagnosis requires the presence of senile plaques and a specific pattern of atrophy in the brain.

I do read German, but I suspect that the German articles would not be translated for me.  I do not know if this situation is unique to dentistry or if it is a common problem in biomedical research.  However, I can tell you that many of my Japanese colleagues read the English language literature and submit their better clinical cases to English language journals.  This may be changing, but I know from personal experience that many Japanese periodontologists and oral surgeons submit their better cases to the Japanese language journals.  This makes it very difficult for the international reader",Reporting of ultrasound findings in the brain should follow the ACR TI-RADS white paper of 2017,"
Even if the author's intent was to enhance the IF of their work, the actual effect is to reduce the IF of the journal.  This is because the IF is based on the number of citations received by the articles published in the journal.  When authors republish their work in another journal, the original publication is still listed in the IF calculation.  This is why some journals have a ""self-citations"" rule in their author guidelines.  For example, JAMA publishers will exclude from the IF calculation articles that have been republished within 4 years - https://jama.net/journal/author/author-guidelines#reprints

Several examples have been provided demonstrating the ability to feign long-term illness for financial gain. A common example is individuals who claim to have cancer. Cancer is a serious illness that is life threatening. It is important that we do not trivialise cancer by pretending to have it. Other examples include claiming to have a serious injury that requires long-term medical care. This is not to say that such injuries do not occur, but they need to be proven with medical evidence.

The problem is that the onus is on the insurance company to prove that the injury is not a genuine one. This is because the insurance contract is contractually between the insured and the insurer. The insurer cannot just say “show me” and expect the insured to prove that the injury is real. The insured does not have to prove that the injury is real, but rather the insurer has to prove that the injury","Access to test results and images, and communication with patients via the web could be a game changer. As an example, consider a patient with malignancy: communication via the web could reduce travel for follow-up visits and enhance communication with the health care provider.

Topic Discussion

This discussion is about the pros and cons of centralized CT scanning for GI bleeding. Centralized scanning can decrease the amount of time to diagnosis and treatment, but it also has some disadvantages, such as loss of efficiency and the risk of damage to the tubing and tracheal cannula. The radiology department should be aware of the risks and benefits of centralized scanning to ensure that patients receive the best possible care.

True","Matching of clinical findings with the appropriate medical terminology is usually done by experienced clinicians who have come to know the patient over time.  For example, a clinician may think, ""oh, this patient has been complaining of memory problems, which is a common symptom of Alzheimer's disease,"" and then go to the medical record to look up the appropriate diagnostic codes.  However, this process is not perfect, and some patients may receive a different diagnosis when they see a different clinician.  To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, clinicians are encouraged to use diagnostic criteria such as those published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).","

Under the current system, a lesion that is not marked is considered 'missed'.  However, a lesion that is not marked but is discussed in the text is not considered 'missed'.

It is important to note that only a trained medical professional can provide the most accurate and comprehensive analysis of any medical findings.,"Dermoscopy is a diagnostic aid that should be used in conjunction with clinical exam and history.  It should not be used in isolation.  Some suggestive features can be seen on dermoscopy (epidermal inclusion cysts with a linear vessel pattern in the absence of scar), but none are pathognomonic.  Typically, these lesions are asymptomatic, and the main indication is to differentiate this from a potential malignant process.  A chronic process is unlikely to be malignant.  The only way to really know is to biopsy the lesion.

With the advent of ultrasound, fetal images have become an important means of communication between healthcare providers, patients, and family members.  An ultrasound image can provide a very personal and intimate glimpse into a mother’s womb and the fetus growing inside.  Some patients may request to view images from their prenatal care; while this may be a reasonable request, healthcare providers should also feel comfortable in declining to show images to patients who are uncomfortable seeing them.  As more ultrasound images are made available to patients, the potential for misuse also increases.  Some patients have been known to sell ultrasound images to tabloids or other media sources.  In some cases, patients have even faked ultrasound images to receive financial compensation.

Sponsors have the right to withhold or publish data based on their interests (or the interests of their stockholders).  Because of the huge profits involved in drug marketing, pharmaceutical companies have an inherent conflict of interest in the interpretation and publication of clinical trial results.  In some cases, companies have withheld data on side effects or efficacy that could have led to stockholder lawsuits.  In other cases, companies have published or released data that exaggerated the benefits of their products.  The FDA has limited resources and must trust the companies to submit all relevant data for review.  The agency also has limited power to force companies to release data that the companies claim is proprietary.

Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (CCAM)

The incidence of CCAM is 1:2000. It is more common in males. Most commonly the malformation is unilateral and confined to the upper lobes. The presence of CCAM is usually a ""one-shot"" situation. The lesion is resected because there is a significant risk of recurrence.

The etiology of CCAM is unknown, but there are several hypotheses:

1. Failure of the pulmonary mesenchyme to migrate into the proximal uterus.
2. Abnormal growth of the mesenchyme and epithelium due to the local accumulation of mesenchyme.
3. Abnormal growth of the mesenchyme and epithelium due to the local absence of capillaries.

The diagnosis of skin lesions is usually made by dermoscopy. The accuracy of dermoscopy in the diagnosis of melanoma is 91% (range 82–96%).

The most common errors in dermoscopy are:

1. Missing a malignant lesion (a metastatic melanoma is one of the most frequently missed malignancies).
2. Misdiagnosing a benign lesion as a melanoma.
3. False interpretation of a lesion as a simple nevus when it is a melanoma in situ.

Congenital CMV is a serious disease.  The primary prevention of the disease is knowledge of the disease and the use of intrauterine acyclovir for women who are seronegative for CMV.  In this case, the ""factoid"" is incorrect.  The disease is not always ""silent"" and can cause serious morbidity.  The following is from the CDC website:

Congenital CMV is a serious but preventable risk to the fetus.  About 1 in 2000 infants (0.5%) are infected and the most serious consequence is neurological damage and developmental disabilities.  Infection can be insidious and difficult to recognize in early pregnancy.  Most women carry a latent infection before the 20th year of life.  CMV can be reactivated during periods of stress",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082332/pdf/AD2018-719685.pdf,"
The diagnosis of skin cancer is usually made by clinical examination. Dermoscopy is an important adjunct to clinical diagnosis. However, inaccurate factual records are systematically used to suggest more expensive treatment options."

Discussion

The breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) is a standardized system used by radiologists to describe mammogram findings, classifying them according to suspicion for malignancy. 
1
 The BI-RADS lexicon is extensive, including descriptors such as “benign findings,” “negative,” “probably benign,” “indeterminate,” “suspicious,” “needs additional imaging evaluation,” “needs biopsy for definitive diagnosis,” and “suspicious for malignancy.”

 However, there are lesions that do not fit neatly into this system.

A biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis.  Mammo and US are usually done yearly after a certain age.  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in pregnant women.  Pregnancy is a time of heightened awareness of breast exams, as the breast tissue is physiologically enlarged.  A woman with a new diagnosis of breast cancer during pregnancy is at a higher risk than a woman with a diagnosis before or after pregnancy.  The younger the woman at the time of diagnosis, the more likely it is that she will have an interval of 10 or more years of survival.

In a study of 274 medical records, 25% of patients’ symptoms were found to be exaggerated or false (Khan, 2013).  In another study of 241 medical records, 32% of patients’ symptoms were found to be exaggerated (Khan, 2013).  This is not to say that patients are lying, but rather that patients’ perceptions of their symptoms are subjective.  This makes it difficult for clinicians to determine the severity of a patient’s illness and the necessary treatment. 
In this case, the patient’s perception of her symptoms is affecting her treatment.  She is experiencing pain and discomfort, and believes she needs surgical intervention.  However, her radiological findings do not support this.",Tracking symptoms over time can help healthcare providers and patients better understand the effectiveness of treatments and the progression of the illness. This can be especially useful in cases where the patient is being treated with medication. It can also be helpful in understanding how environmental factors may be related to the illness or symptoms.,"Mammography and breast exam are diagnostic tools used to detect breast cancer. Mammography is recommended yearly for breast cancer screening in women over 40 years of age. A breast exam is performed by a physician or a nurse practitioner and is often used to make the definitive diagnosis of breast cancer. Symptoms of breast cancer include breast lump, nipple discharge, skin changes, and breast pain. Some women may experience psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depression (1).
If you are experiencing symptoms of breast cancer, it is important to get evaluated by a physician. If you are diagnosed with breast cancer, you may have to go through a scary experience like me.

Critical thinking is essential for the evaluation of all healthcare information.  It is especially important to look at the source of the information, the qualifications of the author, and the purpose of the communication.  It is important to remember that the media often publicizes healthcare issues for different reasons than those of the healthcare provider.  Most often, the media is trying to sell their product and will publicize headlines that will grab the attention of their readers.  This often leads to confusion and misinterpretation of the truth.  It is the responsibility of the individual to evaluate the truth of the information and separate fact from fiction.  This can be difficult with the overwhelming amount of information available and the complexity of the science.  It is important to remember that the media plays a vital role in our society and has the power to influence and change public opinion.  It is important to ask yourself, “Is this factual and unbiased information","Facts are the building blocks of sound public health policy.  A complete and accurate understanding of the facts is the essential first step in formulating sound public health policy.  These facts may be descriptive (e.g. smoking causes lung cancer) or predictive (e.g. salt intake below 15g/day reduces blood pressure).  Regardless, the facts need to be complete and accurate.  In the case of the current pandemic, the relevant facts include:  the causative organism (SARS-CoV) has been isolated;  the incubation period is 7-14 days;  there is no effective treatment;  respiratory precautions do not need to be instituted for COVID-19; and, social distancing does slow the rate of new cases.

","General Discussion
The Radiographic features can be different depending on the location of the epidermoid.  In the CNS, they are typically found in the brain, in the posterior fossa, and associated with the CN.  They are typically supratentorial and at the grey-white matter junction.  There can be a mass effect and disruption of normal brain architecture.  Signal characteristics include: T1 isointense to grey matter, T2 isointense to grey matter, FLAIR isointense to grey matter, DWI restricted diffusion.  They are typically not enhanced after contrast.  If the epidermoid is in the middle ear, it can cause a retrotympanic mass, which can be large.  It can insinuate itself between normal structures, causing erosion and reactive bone.  It can sometimes be mistaken for cholesteatoma.  Epid",No

I was able to obtain the medication prescribed for my chronic illness without actually having it by requesting the prescriber to write a letter stating the diagnosis and why the medication is needed. I then took the letter to my pharmacist, who called the prescriber to request a faxed copy of the letter. The pharmacist then gave me a copy of the faxed letter to turn in at the pharmacy. This way, I was able to fill the prescription without actually having the chronic illness.","Regular medication is important in controlling a chronic illness, such as HTN, by preventing further damage and complications.  It is important that the patient takes the medication as prescribed by their healthcare provider.  Some patients may need to take a different medication or have their medication changed depending on how well they respond to a particular drug.  A patient with HTN may need to take anti-hypertensive medication for the rest of their life to keep their high blood pressure under control.  The patient in the scenario you provided is currently taking medication and follows a healthy diet and exercise program to control his high blood pressure.  He also sees his doctor regularly to have his blood pressure monitored and adjusted as needed.  This helps to prevent further damage from occurring and keeps him in good health.","Prescription drug abuse is a national epidemic.  In the United States, prescription drug abuse is the fastest growing illicit drug problem, with the most commonly abused drugs being opioids, central nervous system depressants, and stimulants.

AI can support the interpretation of medical images by:

- Identifying and tagging abnormalities in medical images,
- Summarizing findings in a concise and organized manner,
- Communicating findings to the referring physician,
- Suggesting further tests and treatments, and
- Assisting in determining a treatment plan.

AI can also aid in identifying potential health issues by:

- Comparing the patient’s images to a large database of reference values, and
- Alerting the physician when the patient’s values are outside the reference range.

In addition, AI can support the training of medical students and residents by:

- Providing consistent and detailed feedback, and
- Allowing residents to focus on complex cases and individual patient issues.

Experts do not always agree.  Sometimes, neither does the computer.  It is useful, however, to have an independent second expert review the same images.  If the two experts do not agree, then a third expert may be helpful.  A good rule of thumb:  If the expert thinks it is in the normal range, then it probably is.  It is much more difficult to make a diagnosis when the expert is not sure.  Sometimes, the only recourse is to say ""I'm sorry, but I do not know"".

The FDA and the medical community have raised significant concerns about the validity of many of the studies submitted to support the approval of Essure. A review of the published literature on Essure shows a persistent pattern of bias in support of the device. In some cases, the device appears to be effective in preventing pregnancy, but it also appears to cause significant numbers of women to experience sterile symptomatic non-rupture uterine erosion, often requiring surgical intervention.

The apparent underreporting of complications in the literature submitted to support the approval of Essure is consistent with the patterns observed in other medical studies supported by the device’s manufacturer, including a study of breast implants, in which only 6% of patients with ruptured implants were reported to have rupture.

Doctors have access to medical history, current medications, and test results that help them determine the best course of treatment for each individual patient.  Some medications have side effects that may interact with other medications a person is taking, and doctors are trained to think about these potential interactions.  In addition, doctors have knowledge of diseases and treatments that goes beyond the laypersons knowledge.  A person who is thinking about taking a new medication should come prepared with questions for their doctor, to get the most out of the visit.  The doctor may suggest new medications, or may feel that changing medications is not necessary.  In the end, the doctor and patient should come to a treatment decision together.

Providers may also have difficulty determining which symptoms are related to a particular problem, especially when patients have multiple medical conditions.  In some cases, symptoms may be unrelated to the medical problem for which the patient is seeking care.  This can lead to billing errors and insurance disputes.  Medical assistants must be aware of the challenges involved in matching symptoms with medical codes and work with providers to ensure correct coding.

""Staging"" is not part of the formal medical coding process. 

Most neurodegenerative disorders are not staged - they are diagnosed based on symptoms and disease progression.

Standardized medical coding does not capture the symptoms or progression","
Symptom descriptions are often too vague to be useful.  Matching symptoms to medical codes is difficult because the codes are written in ""technical"" language, rather than in laymen's terms.  This can lead to physicians matching symptoms to codes in a way that is not completely accurate, which can lead to billing errors and insurance disputes.  In this case, the patient's symptoms were matched to a code that did not completely describe the patient's condition, leading to a denied insurance claim.  The patient was then forced to appeal the decision, which was costly and time-consuming.

Review

The U.S. healthcare system is in a state of flux.  On the one hand, proponents of the American Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) claim that it provides cover to millions of previously uninsured Americans. On the other hand, critics claim that the legislation is socialistic and forces taxpayers to cover the costs of the uninsured.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)

The ACA was signed into law on March 23, 2010.  The law contains a number of provisions that took effect immediately and others that took effect in 2014 and beyond.  The immediate effects include mandating insurance coverage for children under the age of 26, banning insurance companies from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions, and closing the Medicare Part D coverage gap."

ANSWER: b. 

Teaching Point: The goal of medical education is not only to train physicians with the skills and knowledge base to become experts in the field, but also to instill within them a sense of responsibility and ethical integrity. A physician's role is not only to ""do no harm,"" but also to ""do good"" and to ""help others."" This requires not only an understanding of disease pathophysiology, but also an appreciation of the human consequences of illness and treatment. A competent physician","
A model's analysis can be cross-referenced with standard medical guidelines by comparing the visual representation of the model to the written description of the standard. For example, the following paragraph describes the radiographic features of a breast mass on mammography:

These include masses that are not palpable, masses that are palpable but not visible on mammography, and masses that are visible on mammography.

A breast composed of predominantly fatty tissue is classified as ACR B.  This classification is made based on the radiographic appearance of the breast, which is determined by the amount of glandular tissue compared to the amount of fatty tissue.  The radiographic appearance of a fatty breast is different than that of a dense or heterogeneously dense breast.  This is because soft tissue density is determined by the amount of glandular tissue and fibrous tissue, not fatty tissue.  In a fatty breast, the glandular tissue is compressed, and is therefore seen as radiolucent areas, or lighter on the image, whereas in a dense breast, the glandular and fibrous tissue is more prominent, and is seen as radiopaque areas, or darker on the image"

A common and less serious skin condition that can be masked by a Dermoscopy is psoriasis. Psoriasis is characterized by skin redness, scaling, and thickening. It can be caused by an overactive immune system, which leads to inflammation and skin cell proliferation. Although it is not usually serious, it can cause physical and emotional discomfort and stigmatization.

In a post-marketing study of the COX-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, 1868 patients were randomly assigned to receive rofecoxib or dicloxacillin.  Intra-cardiac and urinary extravasation of rofecoxib was observed in 4.5% of patients.  Intra-cardiac rofecoxib was associated with a 3-fold increase in myocardial infarction.  Intra-cardiac dicloxacillin was found in 1.5% of patients, with no increase in MI. 



Rofecoxib was subsequently withdrawn from the US market.
