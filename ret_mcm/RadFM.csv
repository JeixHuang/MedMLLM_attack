Sellar and suprasellar lesions may be imaged with ultrasound.  However, the vast majority of lesions are in the pituitary gland - and are usually not ""sellar"" in location.  Thus, the true sensitivity of ultrasound is much lower than reported - as most lesions are not within the sella/suprasellar cisterns.  Most lesions are peripheral and only enter the sella when the gland is severely atrophic.  However, even then, the cisterns are often too small to allow passage.  Consequently, the reported sensitivity of ultrasound is over 90% - because the authors are including all lesions seen in the sella/cisterns, not just the small minority of lesions that are in the sella/cisterns.

Pandemics and epidemics are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Direct costs are incurred in the acute care setting in the diagnosis and treatment of those who are sick. Indirect costs include lost productivity and income for those who are ill as well as for those who care for the sick. In the US, the cost of a pandemic is estimated at $165 Billion US dollars. In a recent outbreak of Swine flu, there were an estimated 2000 deaths in the US. This is lower than previous estimates of 20-40% for pandemic flu. Since the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, estimates are lower because clinicians are more aware of the dangers of the virus and public health efforts have increased.

```

The autopsy findings are communicated to the family by a trained
autopsist, usually a physician, through discussion with the next-of-kin.

This communication is made in a sensitive, compassionate, and timely
manner to avoid causing excessive grief and distress. The autopsy
findings are typically discussed in person, with the autopsist making it a
point to schedule and conduct the meeting in a private, quiet, and
appropriately somber setting. The autopsist should be prepared to
answer any questions the family may have and, if necessary, provide
emotional support and/or refer the family to appropriate resources
(eg, bereavement groups, support organizations, and so on)

In the previous section, we discussed the use of the model to generate overviews that include only normal-appearing tissue.  Here, we demonstrate the use of the model to generate overviews that deliberately omit abnormal tissue.  We begin with a top-level windowed slice that shows a small region of tumor tissue in the right temporal lobe.  Then, we use the model to generate overviews that omit this small region of tumor tissue.  The overviews show only normal-appearing tissue from the top-level windowed slice.  The model was able to generate overviews that were consistent with the given input.  That is, the model was able to omit the tumor tissue and generate overviews that were consistent with the given input.  The model could also be used in a similar manner to generate overviews that omit other types of abnormal tissue. ",#,#

Discussion: This patient initially had a T11 vertebral body metastasis resected, with subsequent progression of disease, as evidenced by this PET/CT. The patient was then treated with sunitinib, which stopped the advancement of metastatic disease, evidenced by the lack of FDG avidity on this follow up PET/CT. The apparent increase in SUV after treatment is likely due to the fact that the tumor was no longer being treated with glucose-hungry tumor progression. Nonetheless, the control CT, which was performed without the sunitinib, continued to progress, as evidenced by the increase in the area of the soft tissue mass, the destruction of the vertebral body, and the extension of the tumor into the paravertebral soft tissues.",#,1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D 	1D

Visualization and understanding of 3D anatomical models is aided by image-based spatial normalization.  This technique is commonly used in radiology, where a two-dimensional image of a patient is compared to a standard template to determine where the patient's anatomy deviates from the norm.  By comparing the patient's anatomy to a standard template, a physician is able to quickly understand what structures are normal, and where the patient's anatomy may deviate from normal.  

Spatial normalization techniques have been used in medicine for many years.  Probably the most well known example is the use of the 1951 WHO classification of intracranial hemorrhage, which uses a simple template to classify the location of a bleed.  The template is a drawing of a skull with the caption ""Front",#

PM is a key component of quality health care and is essential to containing rising health care costs. PM can reduce mortality from both communicable and non-communicable diseases, decrease hospitalizations, and improve the quality of life for patients. PM is a cost-effective investment that can decrease overall health care costs by preventing or delaying the onset of disease, reducing the severity of disease, and decreasing the number of complications and hospitalizations. PM can also increase productivity by reducing time lost from work for both the patient and the caregiver.
PM is especially important for patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, because they are at higher risk for developing complications.

The optic disc is the anatomical correlate of the physiological blind spot. 

The optic disc is the anatomical correlate of the physiological blind spot. The optic disc is defined by the optic nerve dura mater, which is continuous with the sclera and Tenon’s capsule. The optic nerve dura mater extends anteriorly to the ora serrata (an embryologic remnant of the hyaloid vessel) at the posterior margin of the lens. The ora serrata is usually located within 2.5 mm of the back of the globe. The optic disc is located back from the ora serrata 2 mm. The optic nerve dura mater is continuous with the sclera and Tenon’s capsule, and the sclera is continuous with the ciliary muscle"

Almost half of all patients with RP begin legal blindness within 10 years of the onset of symptoms. 

2. The ""rod-cone"" theory of RP is now universally accepted.  The selective loss of cone cells in RP appears to be a ""layer disease"", with cones in the outer retina (the layer of the retina farthest from the back of the eye) being lost first, and those in the inner retina being lost last. This is in direct contrast to the ""diffuse"" degeneration seen in other retinal diseases.  

3. Several animal models exist for RP.  The rapidly degenerating rd:rds rat carries a recessive mutation for retinal degeneration.  This model shows a dramatic degeneration of the outer retina.

Home remedies have been used since biblical times
to treat illness and disease. 
Examples include willow bark (Salix)
for aspirin, cinchona bark for quinine,
and opium poppy for morphine.











Knowing the proper identification of plants is important for both

A polyp is a benign growth of tissue that projects into the lumen of a hollow organ. Polyps are most commonly found in the colon (hence the term colon polyp), but can also be found in other organs including the stomach, rectum, small intestine, and bladder. Polyps can be categorized in various ways, including size (hyperplastic, or adenoma, or giant), shape, surface, and histological appearance.

It is very important to see a healthcare provider if you are experiencing any symptoms, even if you think they are not severe.  Some symptoms may not seem important to mention at the time, but they could be important in the future.  A healthcare provider can also help determine if the symptoms you are experiencing are related to a underlying medical condition or medication you may be taking.  Some medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or heart problems, may not cause any symptoms, but can still be dangerous.  It is important for a healthcare provider to do a thorough evaluation of your medical history, including any symptoms you may be experiencing, and to make a plan to manage the condition.  This may include changing medications or beginning treatment to manage the symptoms.  It is also important for the healthcare provider to perform regular physical exams to monitor your progress and to make sure the treatment is working",#346,

A patient with a moderate to severe TBI may need continuous medical care for the rest of his/her life.  Depending on the severity of the injury, the patient may need extensive rehabilitation and therapy (both physical and occupational), as well as ongoing medical management of physical and psychosocial complications.  In some cases, the patient may be left with long-term cognitive deficits, such as mild or severe dementia, or personality changes.  Some patients may experience post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, or chronic pain.  In the most severe cases, patients may be left in a permanent vegetative state.  The cost of care for a patient with a moderate to severe TBI can be staggering.  In 2000, the cost of injury and illness in the United States was estimated at $26",#,#

Microadenomas are usually considered to be benign tumors, although there have been reports of aggressive microadenomas.  Most microadenomas have a stable clinical course; however, a small percentage can be associated with clinical syndones, such as acromegaly, hyperprolactinemia, and Cushing’s syndrome.  In this case, the microadenoma was associated with Cushing’s disease.  The adenoma was surgically removed and the patient’s cortisol levels returned to normal."

Benjamin E. Trinacular Heart Disease

Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States.  According to the American Heart Association, it is estimated that approximately 28 million Americans have heart disease, and approximately 610,000 die from it each year.  The most common types of heart disease are coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke.  These diseases can be assessed and evaluated using a number of different imaging techniques.

Symptoms are often described using imprecise language.
There is variability in the language used for the same symptom
There are multiple possible symptoms for any one medical condition
There are different severity levels for any one medical condition
Some medical conditions have few, very specific symptoms
Some medical conditions have many, somewhat non-specific symptoms
Some medical conditions have a long latency period before symptoms appear
Some medical conditions have a long duration of symptoms
Some medical conditions have large individual disease variability in the age of onset and duration of symptoms","# (matching symptoms with medical codes)

typical chest x-ray findings for COVID-19

There are many different types of COVID-19 chest radiograph findings, including some that are common and specific, and others that are nonspecific and atypical.  However, a recent publication from the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology provides a summary of the most commonly encountered chest x-ray features in COVID-19 patients.  PMID: 32280912

It is important to remember that some of these features may also be seen in patients with other types of pneumonia, including bacterial, viral, and mycobacterial infections.  However, the overall clinical picture, along with the patient’s history, can help to differentiate the most likely cause."

Pyloric stenosis is defined as the pyloric muscle’s failure to relax, with associated delayed gastric emptying and vomiting. The incidence is approximately 1:500, and it is three times more common in males. In addition to presenting with vomiting, children with pyloric stenosis often present with non-bilious emesis, abdominal pain, poor weight gain and dehydration, and irritability with feeding. The classic position for discovering pyloric stenosis is when the child is in the supine position, with the examiner lifting and stroking the child’s back in an effort to induce vomiting.

",#,"-Bergstrom syndrome (SBS) is an uncommon condition that was first described in 1968 by a French allergist named Sie######-Bergstrom. SBS is a rare form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis that is caused by an inflammatory reaction to the injection of non-porcine protein products into the body. These products can include bovine and porcine-derived products such as bovine insulin, bovine fibrinogen, and porcine-derived fibrinolytics. It is more commonly seen in women between the ages of 50 to 70 who have a history of atopy & immunoglobulin deficiencies. The exact incidence of SBS is unknown, but it is thought to be under-recognized and under-diagnosed.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the world. In 2010, it was responsible for 1 in every 3 deaths globally. In the UK, CVD death rates are falling - but they are still higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. In the last 20 years, there has been a 15% fall in deaths from heart disease in men and a 36% fall in women. However, in the most deprived areas, deaths from heart disease have actually increased slightly in women. The gap between the highest and lowest rates of death from heart disease in Scotland is 16 years for men and 24 years for women. The gap between the highest and",#

However, women at higher risk for breast cancer, such as those with a positive family history or those with a history of radiation therapy, may require earlier and more frequent exams.  A clinical breast exam is often performed during a mammogram but is best performed before a mammogram.

Adenomyosis is often a ""radiologic diagnosis"" - meaning that the imaging findings are diagnostic.  

There are no ""typical"" imaging findings - but rather a continuum of findings ranging from no adenomyosis to diffuse (i.e. ""diffuse adenomyosis"") to irregular and/or asymmetric thickening of the myometrium to focal nodular areas of thickening (that may or may not be associated with stromal cell proliferation) to masses that are well-circumscribed and non-infiltrative.  

It is unclear whether the adenomyosis is a precursor to, or a consequence of, endometriosis.","# Schema Name: Schema 1

The above section outlines the various diagnostic criteria for the different types of nevi.  It is important to remember that a change in size, shape, or color can signify a transition to a higher-grade lesion.  Thus, any nevus that is changing should be biopsied.  A recent study has suggested that the time it takes for a melanocytic lesion to clear is inversely proportional to its thickness; melanomas took an average of 1.4 years to clear, whereas atypical moles took an average of 10.4 years to clear.  Therefore, it is critical to diagnose atypical moles promptly and treat them expeditiously.  The ABCDE rule is a useful mnemonic that can help the clinician remember the diagnostic criteria for melanoma.  Melanomas typically are of equal or greater diameter than a pigment"

Consistent with the concept of ""plaque-rupture"", the histopathology shows fissures and ulcers involving the superficial layers of the arterial wall and perivascular hemorrhage.  Plaque rupture is probably an underestimate of the actual process, since the outermost portion of the vessel wall is often spared.  The term ""atherosclerotic plaque"" is actually a clinical term, not a histological one.  The presence of a ruptured plaque is the histological equivalent of a clinical diagnosis of atherosclerosis.  Therefore, the presence of a rupture is not necessarily equivalent to a clinical diagnosis of atherosclerosis.  The histological equivalent of a clinical diagnosis of ""atherosclerotic plaque"" is a thick walled medial smooth muscle cell-rich arterial segment",#),# russian: ########################################################################################

Increasingly, the diagnosis of mTBI is being made based on imaging findings.  These findings may be subtle, but may be confirmed by the findings of diffusion weighted MR imaging.  The findings of this study support the contention that there is a significant increase in the number of lesions in patients with mTBI, but that these lesions are not always detectable by conventional MR imaging.  Diffusion weighted imaging, however, is able to detect these lesions.  The findings of this study also suggest that the lesions seen on conventional MR imaging correlate well with the lesions seen on diffusion weighted imaging, but that there is a greater number of lesions identified on diffusion weighted imaging.

Porcelain Gallbladder: a model for cholecystitis in a 6 month old

Rita M. Ricci, MD and Robert P. Healy, MD

The Radiologist, 10.1016/j.radiou.2004.07.006

A 6 month old male was being evaluated for a murmur.  A chest CT was ordered to evaluate for a structural cause.  The CT scan showed a ""porcelain"" gallbladder.  There was no evidence of a gallstone, or of the common bile duct.  There was no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. "

""Treatment of carotid endarterectomy wounds is usually straightforward. Complications can occur, however, such as postoperative bleeding, infection, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and spasm. Pseudoaneurysm and spasm can be avoided with careful surgical technique and appropriate postoperative management. Management of carotid endarterectomy wounds includes careful hemostasis, wound closure that does not spare the internal and external carotid arteries, and prophylactic antibiotics.""

MRI is the imaging modality of choice, providing exquisite anatomical detail (particularly on T1 and T2 weighted imaging) and excellent spatial resolution.  Functional MRI can provide information on the metabolic activity of different regions of the brain, and DWI can detect early changes in cerebral ischemia.  Magnetic susceptibility-based sequences can detect iron deposition in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease.  MR spectroscopy can provide information on the biochemistry of various tissues, including the brain.  Ground-truth must be used when interpreting MR spectroscopy data.

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory, proliferative disease of the skin. 
Psoriasis affects men and women equally. 
The most common age of onset is between 15 and 25 years. 
Psoriasis is estimated to affect 1-3% of the United States population. 
The median age of onset is 42 years. 
Psoriasis is chronic and may persist throughout life. 
Psoriasis is associated with a significant social handicap. 

Psoriasis is defined as ""a chronic inflammatory cutaneous disease of unknown etiology with a predilection for the scalp, where there is a proliferation of keratinocytes, acanthosis, and an absence of epidermal differentiation.""",>#st=3&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o&#ndash;l&#ndash;o

Increased attenuation (density) in the region of the thalamus, on CT, is a fairly sensitive and specific sign of early infarct.  This is due to the anatomy of the region and the flow of CSF.  As the infarct progresses, the increased attenuation moves from the thalamus to the corona radiata and then to the lenticular nucleus.  The infarct also moves from the thalamus superiorly to the corona radiata and then to the lenticular nucleus.  In addition, the density of the infarcted tissue is lower than the density of the surrounding normal tissue.  This is opposed to hemorrhage, which is usually homogeneous in density.  The constellation of these findings on CT are highly specific for acute infarction.

insurance disputes

Symptoms are the earliest manifestation of disease and are often the stimulus for seeking medical care. However, not all symptomatic patients have the specific diagnostic code for the disease. This leads to either under- or over-billing when insurance companies review medical care. A recent article in the New York Times discussed this problem: “A patient with a heart attack might have his condition classified as acute respiratory distress, which is billable, or pulmonary edema, which is not billable.

Monitoring also provides ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of treatment and enables adjustment of the treatment plan as needed to maximize benefit and minimize adverse effects.  In addition, regular monitoring helps to ensure that the treatment plan is being followed, which is important given the complexities of today’s medical treatment regimens.  Involvement of the patient in the monitoring process through use of diaries, calendars, and other self-monitoring techniques can also improve outcomes by increasing the patient’s involvement in and awareness of his or her illness and treatment.
