 The answer is not to analyze such data in a single medical modality.  The goal of medical imaging is to aid in diagnosis, which is a clinical decision.  Clinical decision making is aided by the history, physical exam, and laboratory data.  The radiologist should be aware of the clinical situation, and the clinician should be aware of the imaging findings.  In this case, the clinical diagnosis was made before the imaging findings were fully explored.","BREAST CANCER EPICENTER

Introduction

The goal of this study was to determine if healthcare providers could accurately determine the illness analysis from images. 

Background

The use of imaging in medicine has grown significantly over the past few decades.  Imaging now allows doctors to see what they once could only feel or hear.  While the technology has improved, there still is room for error.  Doctors can be paged at all hours of the day because of the fear that they may miss a diagnosis.  This fear comes from the possibility that a patient may die if certain conditions are not treated in a timely manner.  While this fear may keep some doctors from relaxing while on call, technology has come to the rescue.  The invention of the PDA has allowed doctors to carry images","Specifically, for Alzheimer's disease, what types of feedback can be given to improve the accuracy of the illness analysis from images?
Clinical feedback - Given the stage of the disease, how much does the patient's memory loss correlate with the regions of the brain that are most affected by the illness (medial temporal cortex, hippocampus, etc.)?
Imaging feedback - Are the images being analyzed being analyzed by the most current and best algorithms? For example, the images being analyzed should not be analyzed by only one person, nor should they be analyzed in isolation of other imaging and clinical information. Furthermore, the images should be analyzed by more than just one person.

It’s also vital to discuss possible setbacks and complications with the patient.","Physical, emotional, and social health are necessary for managing an illness. A patient with low physical health may have decreased ability to care for himself and may be at higher risk for injury or complications. A patient with low emotional health may have decreased motivation to care for himself and is at risk for depression. A patient with low social health may have decreased ability to navigate the health care system and may be at risk for forgoing necessary medical care. All three of these factors together are necessary for optimal patient care.","

 no","Markers are used to objectively assess the response to treatment in patients with GBM undergoing treatment. Markers can be used to identify prognostic subgroups or to track the response to treatment using surrogate endpoints that correlate with survival. For example, the introduction of bevacizumab in the treatment of GBM has been associated with a significant increase in overall survival. The use of bevacizumab in the treatment of GBM has been shown to decrease the density of a protein called contrast enhancement, which correlates with the response to treatment and overall survival. Thus, the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of GBM has been associated with an increase in overall survival.

 Dermoscopy and Skin, as a non-invasive and useful tool to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions, has become an important topic in the past few years.  Many dermatologists have come to rely on this tool for their daily practice.  As a result, there has been a proliferation of publications on the subject.  Unfortunately, some of these publications have reported false positive findings and have incorrectly labeled benign lesions as melanoma.  Some of these publications have even suggested the dermoscopic criteria for the diagnosis of melanoma.  As a result, some dermatologists have come to believe that Dermoscopy and Skin can replace traditional histopathology for the diagnosis of melanoma.  However, these publications have been based on the analysis of images of the skin, which has made it possible for the model to manipulate the"

 Cultural context can impact the interpretation of illness images by a model in 3 ways:

1. Cultural differences in the interpretation of illness images can occur.

2. The presence of artifacts may be overlooked in some cultures and misinterpreted in others.

3. Cultural differences in the use of technology may impact the creation and interpretation of illness images.

For example, an Arab patient with a brain tumor that is adjacent to the ventricle may have a higher risk of misinterpretation due to the Halation artifact that is unique to this modality.

Likewise, a patient with a brain tumor adjacent to the tentorium may be at a higher risk of misinterpretation due to the presence of streak artifacts that are unique to CT scanners with x-ray tube sweep designs.

 Cultural context can impact the interpretation of illness images in 3 ways:

1. Cultural differences in interpreting illness images can impact diagnosis and treatment.
2. Cultural differences in interpreting illness images can impact research and outreach.
3. Cultural differences in interpreting illness images can impact medical tourism.

Examples of cultural context impacting the interpretation of illness images:

1. Different cultures have different views of disease and illness, which can impact diagnosis and treatment. For example, the concept of “face” in some Asian cultures leads to avoidance of direct sunlight and surgical interventions for skin problems [1].

General Information:
Glaucoma is an eye disease that can cause damage to the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. It is usually caused by increased pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure), which can lead to stress and inflammation on the optic nerve. The optic nerve damage is usually permanent, and the treatment is mainly focused on slowing down the progression of the disease.

 Discussion

The correct identification of the condition is dependent on the ability to recognize the signs of the disease in the images. The signs of RRD in this case were subtle and not always present in all images. If the examination was limited to the optic disc, then the condition could have been easily overlooked. This highlights the importance of examining the entire fundus and the importance of using all available modalities to asses the patient properly.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used to assess the retina, but it does not assess the optic disc.
When fundus color photography and OCT are used in combination, they can be used to assess the optic disc and retina.
 However, fundus color photography and OCT are limited in assessing the optic nerve head and retina, respectively.
 Therefore, a multimodal imaging approach that uses a combination of fundus color photography, OCT, and other imaging techniques is ideal for assessing various pathologies.

Most patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) experience their first symptoms between 65 and 75 years of age. However, some people develop AD earlier (before age 65) - a condition known as early-onset AD. In rare cases, people develop AD before the age of 50.  Early-onset AD has been linked to genetic factors, and researchers believe that genetic factors may also be involved in the development of AD later in life.  Early-onset AD has been studied less frequently than late-onset AD, and therefore less is known about the course of the disease, including the rate of progression and the response to treatment.  Clinical trials have shown that the progression of AD, whether slow or rapid, is ultimately fatal.","

However, mammography has its limitations, including false-positive and false-negative results. False-positive results occur when the mammogram shows a finding that suggests a malignant process but is ultimately determined to be benign; these can be due to various factors including technical problems, breast composition, and inflammatory processes. False-negative results occur when the mammogram shows a finding that suggests a benign process but is ultimately determined to be malignant; these can be due to various factors including technical problems, low contrast of the lesion, and experience of the interpreter.

Most commonly, dermoscopy is performed by dermatologists, but also by primary care providers, pediatricians, and even emergency room physicians.  Dermoscopy is an example of a procedure that can be performed without a dedicated machine.  A dermatoscope is used, but any handheld, fixed magnification device with polarized light will suffice.  For example, a pair of reading glasses with a magnification button attached can work perfectly well for this purpose.  The key is to have a magnification of at least 10x, and to use a polarizing filter.  With these two things, one can perform an adequate dermoscopy.

However, these programs have had mixed results in improving survival rates, with some studies citing increased detection rates, while others suggest that the overall rates have remained the same.

A common misconception is that mammography is also a tool for evaluating breast pain or other complaints. 
In fact, mammography is primarily used for evaluating the breast tissue itself, such as looking for masses, calcifications, or other changes. 
Breast pain or other complaints, while important, is not typically evaluated in the mammogram itself. 
Rather, the radiologist will evaluate the breast tissue and, based on that evaluation, will recommend further evaluation for breast symptoms. 
For example, if there are masses, the radiologist may recommend additional mammographic views to get a closer look at those masses.

However, the sensitivity of mammography is variable, depending on breast echotexture, breast density, and the experience of the radiologist.  Mammography is also limited in the detection of microcalcifications.  For these reasons, mammography is often followed with an adjunct imaging modality, such as ultrasound or MR, to increase sensitivity.

 about Interpreting Illness Trends in Large Image Datasets
The Radiographic features can be summarized as follows.Ultrasound: Ocular ultrasound demonstrates an echogenic band of tissue that extends from the posterior choroidal vessel to the back of the eye.
CT: The CT appearance can be quite variable. The classic description is a focal region of retrolental high attenuation situated between the posterior globe and the optic disc. The morphology is variable, ranging from a localized nodule to a large mass-like lesion. Large lesions tend to be diffuse, extending out to the orbital apex. Smaller lesions tend to be discretely marginated. The morphology is thought to reflect the organization of the fluid within the lesion.
MRI: The MR appearance matches that of the underlying pathology",Mammo Screening Simulated,"

A corollary to this misconception is that a CT slice actually has 3 dimensions:  the antero-posterior dimension, the cranio-caudal dimension, and the thickness of the area being imaged.

The key is that the differential is specific for the person generating the differential.  This is where things get interesting.  A competent dermatologist can look at the same lesion and generate a completely different differential.

Issues with imaging and text data

1. Images are often poor representations of the underlying pathology - especially in the retina
2. Different imaging modalities use different data/space representations
3. Images are often enhanced with dye, making them difficult to compare
4. Retinal images are often captured in a non-standard way
5. Medical imaging often suffer from noise, resolution limitations, and light attenuation
6. Medical imaging often suffer from subtlety masking
7. Medical imaging often suffer from edge and boundary problems

10. Medical imaging often suffer from artifacts (e.g. eye movement, blinking, etc.)

Solutions for multimodal medical imaging

1. Use of standardized image capture protocols","Dental radiography (DR) and CT have different resolutions, fields of view, and contrasts. DR is often used to assess the ""health"" of the teeth, while CT is used to assess the ""health"" of the *whole* head and neck.  Thus, while DR and CT are both used to assess the teeth, they are often used for very different purposes.  One way to exploit this common challenge is to use DR and CT to assess the teeth in two very different contexts.  For example, DR might be used to assess the teeth in the clinic, while CT might be used to assess the teeth in the emergency department.  Thus, the *location* of the dental radiography and CT scan can be used as a ""clinical context"" to help avoid misinterpretation and correct misinterpretation.

Discussion

 Airway Invasive procedures (e.g., endoscopy, bronchoscopy) are common in medicine and are often performed without an adequate understanding of a patient's anatomy.  This case demonstrates how a simple mismatch in patient information can lead to serious complications.  In this case, the anatomy was known, but the physicians did not know that the “left lung” they were looking at was actually the “right lung” – and vice versa.  This is a good example of how a lack of communication can lead to errors.  There are a number of ways to prevent this kind of error, including: 

1. Use standardized forms with check boxes for anatomy. 
2. Use standardized reports with check boxes for anatomy. 
3. Communicate clearly with other physicians regarding anatomy. 
4. Use standardized sign-out"

A dataset with a varied range of images is
very important in training a medical model to analyze images of illness.

Explanation:
In radiology, there is a large range of abnormalities that a model must
learn to recognize and analyze. A model that is trained on a limited
selection of these abnormalities will not be able to accurately
differentiate between normal and abnormal tissue on a new image
outside the training set. For this reason, a large and varied training
set is essential to achieving high accuracy in analyzing medical images
for diagnosis and treatment.","The importance of a varied dataset in training a medical model for analyzing images of illness was demonstrated in a study of deep learning in detecting pulmonary embolism. A dataset of 180 CTs with and without pulmonary embolism was used to train a model to detect the presence of embolism. The model was then tested on an independent dataset of 80 CTs with and without pulmonary embolism. The study found that the model had a 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity in detecting pulmonary embolism. 

Another study used a dataset of more than 1,000 chest radiographs with and without COVID-19 to train a model to accurately detect the presence of COVID-19. The model had a 98% accuracy rate at detecting COVID-19.

Sharing medical knowledge between specialists using AI techniques

The role of AI in medicine is to provide the right specialist with the right information at the right time. This is done by:

- Collecting data from various sources (like imaging, lab tests, and environmental factors)
- Processing & analyzing the data to provide a specific assessment of the patient
- Structuring the knowledge in a way that is understandable to other specialists
- Interpreting the data in the context of the patient’s history and the current specialist’s area of expertise
- Communicating the findings effectively to the specialist who will provide the next level of care

This process is facilitated by computer systems that can interface with the electronic medical record, as well as the imagers and the clinicians.

AIs can provide a great deal of assistance in many areas, including:

- Identifying important findings","No, it would not be appropriate for an AI to decide which specialists are better than others based on treatment outcomes and publicly rank them. This would be a violation of the ethical norms of medicine and science.  It would also be difficult, if not impossible, to do this in an objective manner.  A patient’s outcome is dependent on many factors, including the specialist’s experience and skill, the patient’s initial health status, and their compliance with treatment recommendations, to name a few.  A public ranking could be harmful to both patients and specialists, causing both to be distrustful of the system and potentially deterring patients from seeking care.  Specialists could also be reluctant to publish papers or participate in conferences for fear of being publicly ranked and shamed."

It is also useful for evaluating patients with dyspnea or those whose lung disease is not confirmed by a chest radiograph because of the improved spatial resolution of CT.  CT allows the clinician to identify patterns of lung disease and its complications much earlier than would be possible with plain radiographs.  Thus, CT is now being used routinely in many countries in patients with clinical suspicion of pulmonary disease.  However, because of the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure, CT should not be used indiscriminately.  Rather, the decision to use CT for evaluation of a patient should be made on an individual basis.  The risk of radiation exposure must be weighed against the likelihood of finding an abnormality that will change management.  Fortunately, because of technological advances, CT is now a","

Informing patients about their illness, treatment, and prognosis is a basic and important aspect of medical care.  It is essential that patients are involved in the management of their illnesses.  This can only be accomplished through effective communication and education.  The physician must take the time to explain to the patient what is happening, what the options are, and what the likely outcomes will be.  The patient’s understanding of the situation will affect their compliance with treatment, their ability to recognize complications, and their emotional well-being.  Medical care must be adapted to the patient’s level of understanding.  Some patients will require more time, more explanation, and more detail.  Others will require a more basic understanding.  The physician must be able to assess each patient’s level and adapt his or her education and communication to that level. 

Abstract
Alzheimer disease is the","Very Important. As the patient stated ""I had no idea I had a problem with my heart. I just thought I was out of shape. No one told me I had a hole in my heart. I wish they would have."".

Educating the patient is essential to the successful treatment of any chronic illness.  Empowering the patient with knowledge regarding their treatment and expectations for improvement can only improve the outcome.","Based on the images, there is increased signal in the temporal lobes, worse on the right.  There is also some increased signal in the frontal lobes bilaterally.  The pattern is not definitive for Alzheimer’s dementia, but does suggest damage in the temporal lobes that could possibly be related to Alzheimer’s.  The frontal lobe involvement could be supportive of the diagnosis.  However, other conditions could also cause this pattern, such as multi-infarct dementia, diffuse Lewy body disease, metabolic disorders, or even hydrocephalus.  A definitive diagnosis would require further clinical information and evaluation."

This case nicely demonstrates the classic CT findings of aortic coarctation.  Patient presentation was typical for coarctation with the classic triad of claudication, hypertension, and diminished/absent femoral pulses.  The fact that the patient was young and slender made the diagnosis somewhat surprising.  The patient was not considered to be in heart failure at presentation, although the echocardiogram was obtained at the time of diagnosis.  The patient was subsequently treated with balloon septoplasty to relieve the coarctation.

90% of the time, a model will give a false sense of security by missing a critical diagnosis.","Model-based diagnosis can assist healthcare professionals in differential diagnosis by narrowing down the diagnosis based on the symptoms presented by the patient. This can be particularly useful for diseases with a high degree of diagnostic certainty, such as primary progressive aphasia, or when there is a high degree of clinical uncertainty.

A model can also assist healthcare professionals by providing a common language and a framework for understanding the clinical presentation of a disease. This can be particularly useful for communicating with patients and their caregivers, and can help to empower patients by giving them an understanding of the disease that affects them.

The use of models in healthcare is not without controversy. While models can provide a useful framework for understanding disease, they can also oversimplify the disease and its presentation, and can even cause harm when used inappropriately. Therefore, it is important for healthcare professionals to understand the",Model-based training of ultrasound-guided transjugular liver biopsy in pigs,"90% sensitivity, 90% specificity. A model that is ""good enough"" in AI-assisted diagnosis is one that is both sensitiveitive and specific.
Sensitivity is the ability to correctly identify positive cases (true positives). Specificity is the ability to correctly identify negative cases (true negatives).

If a model has a high specificity, it will have a low false positive rate.  However, it may have a high false negative rate.  Conversely, a model with a high sensitivity will have a low false negative rate, but a high false positive rate.

In radiology, false positives (misdiagnoses) can have serious consequences.  Missing a critical diagnosis can lead to patient harm.  Therefore, in radiology, models should have both high sensitivity and high specificity - a ""double-threshold"" of accuracy."

Yes, I agree with you! I think sometimes we as doctors get so used to certain images that we forget that not everyone has seen or heard of them before.  I think the ""normal"" images are just as important to share as the abnormal findings, so that we can all be on the same page and not waste each other's time.  I mean, no one would get excited about a normal chest x-ray, but it's still important to know that it is normal!  Similarly, the normal image of the appendix in this case is important for everyone to know about, so that we can all be on the same page and not waste each other's time with a discussion that is already over!","General awareness of an illness is important for patient safety. However, it is important to balance general awareness with specificity. A high level of specificity is needed to avoid ""shot-gun"" diagnoses, while a low level of specificity is needed to avoid missing important patterns. The goal is to strike a balance between these two extremes. In the case of a subarachnoid hemorrhage, for example, it is important to alert the neurosurgeons or neurologists because they may need to change the surgical approach. On the other hand, alerting the cardiologist is important so that he or she can inform the patient of any new risks. In this case, the radiologist's note, ""Without further information, this is a nonspecific subarachnoid hemorrhage,"" may be helpful.",DON'T DO THIS

Review

The use of checklists has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in surgical patients.  Complete and accurate documentation is essential for quality assurance and patient safety.  The use of checklist in the OR has been shown to improve compliance with evidence-based standards of care, decrease surgical errors, reduce complications, and shorten the length of surgery.  The checklist should be completed before the patient leaves the OR to ensure that all significant intraoperative findings are communicated to the next provider of care.  A separate checklist for the recovery area ensures that the recovery team is aware of the patient’s needs and the specifics of the operation.  The use of checklist in the recovery area has been shown to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes.

Discussion
The use of a checklist when interpreting a chest Xray can help decrease errors. A good checklist should include questions that address the following:
- Is the side of the chest Xray properly labeled?
- Are the borders of the lung clearly visible?
- Are the pulmonary vasculature and the hila clearly visible and normal?
- Are there any abnormalities in the cardiothymic silhouette?
- Are",No,No,"

It is also used to evaluate the maxilla and mandible for any pathology, such as cysts, tumors, or osteomyelitis.  OPGs are very useful in trauma cases.  In cases of facial fractures, an OPG is the first imaging study.  An OPG can also be used to evaluate the airway.  If a patient is unable to lie flat","Chest radiographs and CT scans are commonly used to make the diagnosis of pulmonary TB.  Tuberculosis in adults is usually asymptomatic and so diagnosis relies on radiographic evidence combined with a +AFB.  The most common site of TB is the lungs (60-70% of all cases) followed by the lymph nodes, pleura, CNS, skin, eyes, kidneys and bones.  The most common respiratory manifestation is cough (up to 60% of all patients) and this usually occurs at the early stage of reactivation TB.  Chest radiographs are used to assess the presence of TB, its extent and site, and presence of complications such as pleural effusions, collapse of lung tissue, and destruction of bone and the ribs.

As a result, Mammo-MRI has been advocated for use in the triage of patients with newly-detected breast masses, to determine which patients require surgical intervention.

However, a 2013 study [2] found that up to 64% of patients had no visible cancerous cells on Mammo-MRI. As a result, there has been debate about the appropriate use of Mammo-MRI, and whether its use is cost-effective.

However, this information should be used judiciously in the workplace, to avoid discrimination against individuals who may be genetically predisposed to a condition, but who do not currently have the disease.  For example, an individual may carry a mutation associated with colon cancer, but may not have developed the cancer yet.  An employer should not use this information to determine the employee’s eligibility for a promotion or other benefit, unless there is a clear occupational risk factor involved.  In this case, the employer should consider the potential for occupational exposure to asbestos, and the associated risk of mesothelioma.  However, even in this situation, the employer should not act on the information, because it is the responsibility of the healthcare provider to communicate the results of genetic tests to the patient.  The",Genetics,Genetics,"Genetic testing can reveal an increased risk for a disease or condition, but it cannot reveal the actual disease or condition.  A positive test for a particular gene does not confirm the presence of a specific disease; rather, it indicates a higher likelihood of developing the disease.  For example, a positive test for the BRCA-1 gene does not mean that the person has breast cancer, but rather, is at a higher risk for developing breast cancer.  A negative test does not mean that the person is free of risk, as genetic testing cannot predict when or if a person will get a disease or condition.  Genetic testing can be useful in evaluating family history of disease, predicting likelihood of developing a disease, and determining treatment options.  However, it is important to understand the limitations of genetic testing and not to rely on test results alone to make medical decisions.

For example, if a patient has a rash and a running nose, allergic contact dermatitis is a possibility. However, if the rash is pruritic (itchy) and the nose is dry, allergic contact dermatitis is unlikely. Clinicians often keep a differential diagnosis in mind while awaiting confirmatory test results.","Matching of clinical findings with the appropriate medical terminology is usually done by using codes or classifications that are specific to the diagnosis in question.

Discussion

Dental x-rays are commonly used in medicine in the diagnosis of periapical disease, trauma, and maxillofacial injuries.  In the case of trauma, the use of a panorex (a modified type of OPG) can help with the diagnosis of facial fractures.  However, when dental x-rays are used in medicine, the images are often not optimally produced or evaluated.  In this case, the dental x-ray was incorrectly identified and labeled by the technician and the findings were not picked up by the radiologist.  This case demonstrates how critical it is for radiologists to look at all images that are potentially relevant to the clinical scenario.  In a case of trauma, where there is a concern for a maxillofacial injury, the radiologist must look at all images of the maxillofacial region, including",Review of the CT images by the author of this factoid.,Verify with a radiologist,"
Hospitals do not have a ""checking"" process.  They have a quality assurance process that is designed to detect errors and correct them before they reach the patient.  This process is not perfect, but it does work most of the time.  The problem is that medical errors often occur in a setting where they are difficult to detect (e.g. ICU at night).

Follow-up visits also provide an opportunity for the healthcare provider to monitor for any potential complications or side effects of the treatment, and to adjust the treatment plan if necessary. The specifics of the follow-up plan will depend on the patient’s individual medical history, current symptoms, and overall health status.","Identifying an illness through an image is only the first step in patient care.

 Someone living in a remote environment with poor access to health care, as is common in many parts of the world, presents a different set of challenges.  In addition to the problems outlined above, one must consider the challenges of simply getting to a health care provider.  This becomes even more difficult if the person is elderly, disabled, or otherwise unable to travel.  Vascular disease, common in the developed world, is even more of a concern in remote areas.  The cost of a CT scan or MRI in the developed world is trivial compared with the cost of transportation to a health care facility in a remote area.  Diseases such as Parkinson\'s often cause severe debilitation and require long-term management.  Someone living in a remote area may not have access to the drugs or the physicians able to manage the drugs.  In addition, rehabilitation therapy is often essential to optimize the","Endoscopy and Gastroent. are both performed to manage and diagnose problems in the stomach and intestinal tract.  The environment in which the patient lives can affect both their susceptibility to disease and the management of that disease.  For example, a patient who is malnourished, living in a polluted area, or has poor access to health care is at higher risk of gastric cancer.  Similarly, a patient with poor access to health care is less likely to have an early diagnosis and treatment of their disease.  This, then, leads to complications and poor prognosis.","Never attribute disease to living conditions, except in the rare case of an identifiable cause.

If unsure if a finding is due to a living condition or an environmental factor, take more images and/or videos, and/or ask the patient to change location, and/or ask the patient to change their daily routine for a week.

Do not ascribe disease to an environmental factor unless absolutely necessary, because it may lead to litigation and/or social unrest.

Do not attribute disease to a living condition unless absolutely necessary, because it may lead to litigation and/or social unrest.

If still unsure, describe the finding as a possible disease and/or environmental factor and suggest a follow-up study to clarify.

Do not ever mislead a patient by stating that a finding is a disease when it is a living condition, or vice versa.

 it is the young who are most likely to survive and to respond to treatment.

With a 15% survival rate, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the U.S.  It is also an illness that is often not detected until it is advanced.  As a result, there is a great deal of interest in finding ways to diagnose it earlier.  One of the promising avenues of research has been the study of the duodenal biopsies taken during the commonly performed EGDs.  Several studies have found that these biopsies, which are routinely thrown away, can be used to diagnose pancreatic cancer.  In a 2011 study, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh reported that they were able to identify six out of ten patients with duodenal biopsies that ultimately were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

This would allow the image to be placed in a columnar format on a computer screen, and would allow the image to 'flow' from left to right, and from top to bottom on a computer screen.  The image could also be made to 'flow' in other directions, if the software allows.  This would make it much easier for the reader to see the image in a fashion similar to looking at a real endoscope, without having to continually move the endoscope back and forth.

The law applies to all U.S. health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers. In the context of fetal medicine, the law applies to all covered entities that may possess PHI. An individual's right to privacy is protected by the law, and informed consent is required before the disclosure of PHI. However, the law allows for disclosure of PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, and it also allows for disclosure to family members.

Regular monitoring for such complications is important for patient outcomes.  This is especially true in patients with an ocular contusion involving the retina.  The tear can identify the retina and result in a retinal detachment.  The initial impact trauma may not cause a retinal detachment, but may cause a tear.  The tear allows fluid to accumulate under the retina.  This fluid causes a detachment.  Early detection and treatment are key to successful patient outcomes.

NICU babies are often treated for a long period of time and the medical care is usually very expensive.  In China, the parents are not allowed to leave the hospital until the baby is well enough to be cared for at home.

The diagnosis of skin cancer is usually made by an examination of the skin surface. The diagnosis is made with the history and the dermoscopic findings. The clinical differential diagnosis is broad, and the clinician must be able to recognize the spectrum of clinical patterns in order to arrive at the correct diagnosis. The dermoscopic patterns are usually pathognomonic, but the dermoscopic findings must be correlated with the clinical findings. The dermoscopic findings may be different in early, late, or recurrent lesions.

Such an ultrasound finding would be a poor discriminator for Down syndrome.  The diagnosis would be better served by absence of calvaria or presence of a proboscis or some other gross anomaly.  As a result, the courts have ruled that the use of a ""snowcapping"" appearance is sufficient.  In this case, the defendant was charged with second degree murder.  In some states, the charge would have been first degree murder.  The difference is that in a first degree murder, the defendant's actions were premeditated.  In a second degree murder, the defendant did not have time to reflect on his actions.  In this case, the defendant was charged with second degree murder because the act was impulsive.  The same ruling could have been applied to a first degree murder.","

 A multimodal medical model can be uncertain about its analysis of illness from images in two ways: (1) when the images present with artifacts that make it difficult to interpret the images, and (2) when the images present with non-specific features that make it difficult to interpret the images. In the first situation, communication between the model and the user is critical to clearly express the uncertainty due to artifacts. In the second situation, communication between the model and the user can be helpful to discuss possible causes of non-specific features and to discuss any possible further tests that might be useful.","Dermoscopy is an important tool for pemphigus vulgaris, bullous systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatitis herpetiformis, and morphea."

Pregnancy is a normal physiologic process that prepares the mother's body for the birth of the fetus. The fetus develops inside the uterus from the time of conception to birth. The first 3 months of pregnancy are considered the first trimester. Each month of pregnancy has specific characteristics that prepare the fetus for life outside the uterus. During the first trimester, the fetus undergoes rapid cell growth and the development of major organs and body parts.

In addition to assisting with diagnoses, AI can also help predict the outcomes of treatments, such as the effectiveness of cancer treatments or the likely progression of lung disease over time. This can be useful for determining the best course of treatment and monitoring the response to that treatment.
Artificial intelligence can also be used in other areas of chest imaging, such as analyzing X-rays and CT scans, to identify abnormalities or flag areas that","US (ultrasound) is used for diagnostic purposes in many countries, including the US, to determine the presence and extent of breast cancer. 
AI techniques could be used to analyze patient feedback to improve the healthcare services. 
Specifically, AI could be used to analyze the patient feedback in the following ways:
- Performing data analysis to determine the most common themes and topics
- Summarizing the feedback
- Coding the feedback using standardized language

This pressure falls most heavily on primary care doctors, who are the ""front line"" of medicine.  Doctors in all specialties receive a constant barrage of sales pitches for new and expensive tests, drugs, and devices.  Doctors, nurses, and technicians get caught up in the hype.

This can be especially helpful in managing chronic illnesses or conditions that develop over time, such as cancer. It can also be useful in managing mental health conditions that may cause fluctuating symptoms. A patient who keeps a close record of their symptoms and treatment progress can play an active role in managing their illness and improving their quality of life.","Tracking symptoms over time can help clinicians and patients better manage the illness.  It can help to identify patterns of symptoms and their severity, and to make more informed treatment decisions.  For example, a patient with recurrent breast cancer may undergo more frequent imaging or earlier intervention for new symptoms, which may include a change in medication or other treatment.  A patient with a chronic illness can use symptom tracking to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and make adjustments as needed.  Symptom tracking can also be used to help diagnose a medical condition, as the patient can provide detailed information about their symptoms and their progression over time.","Mammography is an example of a diagnostic imaging procedure that is widely available and routinely performed.  While it is true that the vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed in women over the age of 50, it is important to remember that BIRADS 2 (benign findings) can be seen in younger patients.  In fact, the majority of women under age 40 with breast cancer are diagnosed incidentally, as younger women are less likely to have routine screening mammograms.  A 2007 study found that only 21% of women aged 30-39 had ever had a mammogram.  While the overall rate of mammography has increased in recent years, the rate for women aged 30-39 has actually decreased.

Most chronic illnesses require routine follow-up care to monitor progression of the illness, evaluate treatment response, and detect complications.  This is particularly true in breast care.  Routine follow-up care includes periodic clinical breast examinations, performed by a physician or a nurse, and mammography, an X-ray test that can detect early signs of breast cancer.  In the case of this patient, her routine follow-up care included an annual mammogram, performed every year since she was 45 years old.  The images were read as normal by an on-site radiologist.  However, because of her family history of breast cancer, she was referred to a high-risk breast care clinic where she received additional attention and a focused mammogram.

 As a non-invasive and inexpensive test, ultrasound is an excellent modality for monitoring a chronic illness such as atherosclerosis.  In this case, the patient returned for repeat exams in order to track the progression of his disease.  Many guidelines recommend routine check-ups in order to screen for various chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, and osteoporosis.  These guidelines vary depending on the patient’s risk factors and medical history.  A routine check-up might include various labs, stool-based tests, and physical exams.  The patient might also undergo further testing such as an ultrasound or CT scan if certain symptoms or risk factors are present.

It is often the procedure of choice for evaluation of chest trauma.  While there are no absolute contraindications to CT, relative contraindications include pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, depressed renal function, and allergy to the contrast medium.  The contrast medium is usually given intravenously, but may be administered via other routes as well.  One must keep in mind that CT is a relatively safe procedure that uses ionizing radiation to produce images.  The radiation exposure of a standard chest CT is equivalent to 60-90 chest x-rays.  The risk of developing cancer from radiation exposure is small and is usually considered to be less than 1% at this level of exposure.  The risk of cancer can be as high as 40% in patients who have had an atomic-bomb bl","Ultrasound is an excellent screening modality for carotid stenosis.  It is also very useful as a surveillance tool for patients who have had an endarterectomy or stenting of the carotid arteries.  An important consideration when evaluating a carotid ultrasound is to assess not only the severity of stenosis but also the degree of calcification of the carotid artery.  Calcification is an important indicator of atherosclerosis and is a frequent cause of stenosis.  The double lumen sign is a direct sign of a hemodynamically significant stenosis.  Other considerations when looking at a carotid ultrasound include assessing for evidence of congenital heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, and giant cell arteritis.","No, this is a real image.

A negative mammogram does not exclude the possibility of malignancy and a biopsy is required if there is clinical suspicion.  In this case, the images were obtained prior to excisional biopsy and the primary tumor was not palpable.  The mammogram is abnormal and suspicious but is not specific.  In a patient with a negative mammogram, other modalities can be employed to localize the tumor if clinically indicated.  In this case, ultrasound was helpful in localizing the tumor and guiding the biopsy.","No image can be used to monitor the progress of a disease, but a series of images over time can be used to track the progression of a suspected diagnosis.  This is true in the case of both carotid ultrasound and for the evaluation of intracranial imaging.  Changes in the appearance of an image over time can indicate changes in the underlying tissue and/or the progression of a disease process.  However, it is important to note that changes in imaging over time may not necessarily indicate progression of a disease.  For example, if a patient with carotid artery disease undergoes a carotid endarterectomy, subsequent images may demonstrate post-surgical changes, which may appear different from the progression of the disease.","Mammography is typically used to evaluate the breast tissue for any abnormalities, such as masses, calcifications, or architectural distortion.  Images are compared with previous studies to determine if there has been a significant change over time.  In the case of insurance fraud, a patient would need to have a biopsy proven malignancy and then undergo treatment to have a change in the appearance of the breast on mammography.  For example, a patient may have a mammogram prior to initiation of treatment that shows a large mass in the breast and then after a few treatments, the mass is no longer visible on mammography.  This would need to be verified by other imaging studies as well as biopsy.  Another example would be a patient that has a suspicious finding that is not cancer, such as a sclerosing adenosis.

This management involves pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Pharmacologic treatment includes the use of NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and biologic response modifiers such as TNF inhibitors.  Nonpharmacologic treatment includes physical therapy, exercise, and assistive devices.  Surgical intervention may be necessary in certain cases.

This is an excellent point.  As an extension of the radiology report, I would like to add that the referring physician/provider should be contacted directly with any concerns or questions about the patient's imaging.  As the one who ordered the ultrasound, they are ultimately responsible for any errors that may have occurred in the interpretation and communication of the results.","CT is a diagnostic tool for many conditions.  However, the accuracy of the diagnosis is based on the interpretation of the radiologist.  Therefore, it is important to have a good knowledge of the patient's clinical history, physical exam findings, and laboratory values to ensure the most accurate diagnosis.

Dear Editor,
As you know, the use of digital technology in medical training is increasing. 
Studies have demonstrated that digital technology can be used in the teaching of 
dermoscopy and that it can be a useful tool for learning and training in 
dermatology and all specialties that use dermoscopy.

Digital technology can be used in two ways: 
1. As an auxiliary tool in the learning process and to provide additional 
information about dermoscopy lesions.
2. As an independent diagnostic tool for use by non-specialists.

In the first way, digital technology can be used in the learning process 
themselves, either in the classroom or in distance learning. In this 
situation, the digital technology provides additional information about 
dermoscopy lesions and can be used to provide additional information 
about the lesions.

As the periventricular fluid accumulates outside of the cerebrum, the ventricles are dilated.  The dilated ventricles then create a vascular region that is susceptible to hemorrhage.  As the intracranial pressure increases, the extra-axial space fills with fluid.  This produces a mass effect on the brain that causes cortical swelling and decreases the amount of cerebrospinal fluid.  This, in turn, decreases the production of cerebrospinal fluid by the choroid plexus.  The net result is a cycle of increasing intracranial pressure, decreasing cerebrospinal fluid, and cortical swelling.

Discussion

The chest film findings in this patient are classic for pneumothorax.  There is an absence of lung markings beyond the pleural margin and lung edge.  No mediastinal shift is present.  If the pneumothorax is not present, then a lung edge cannot be identified.  The pleural margin is seen as a black line between the high density ribs and high density lung.  If there is a medial shift of the mediastinum then the pleural margin is seen as a thin line, rather than a black line, at the high density ribs.  The absence of lung markings peripheral to the pleural margin is diagnostic of pneumothorax.  If lung markings are present peripheral to the pleural margin, then it is necessary to determine if the margin is actually a skin fold.  One way to make this distinction is to ask the patient"

The FDA has issued a warning regarding the use of GH for the treatment of GH deficiency. 

GH stimulates growth and proliferation of tumor cells, and may mask the diagnosis of cancer by increasing the apparent density of normal tissue. 

GH may also stimulate the growth of existing tumors, and may shorten the time between cancer diagnosis and the start of puberty in children with GH deficiency.

The FDA recommends that:

GH be used for the treatment of GH deficiency only

INTRODUCTION

Ovarian torsion (OT) is the most common complication of an otherwise benign condition known as ovarian dermoid cysts, also referred to as mature cystic teratomas.
1
 Ovarian dermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic until they become large enough to cause the condition known as ""intermittent torsion,"" which is characterized by a cyclical pattern of self‐limiting episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
2
 The episodes become more frequent and severe until the cysts eventually become torsed and hemorrhagic.

 The condition is more common in women of reproductive age, with a median age of 22 years, and it occurs bilater","History and physical examination, laboratory tests and Imaging.

Most of the time, the ""chronic disease"" is actually a normal variant that is unrelated to any complaint.  The medical record is often used to justify long-term medication use - for example, ""the patient has had a thyroid nodule for years and the FT4 is really low so I gave her a prescription for a year of thyroid pills"".  The truth is that the FT4 is often normal - but the patient has a ""Thyroid Goiter"" that is a normal variant.

The solution is to take images to demonstrate that the ""long-term medication"" is actually a normal variant.  For example, the ""Thyroid Goiter"" is often a normal variant.  Taking images to demonstrate that the ""goiter"" is actually a normal variant can prevent a long-term medication habit.

It is a simple test that can detect early cellular changes in the cervix, which can prevent cancer. During this visit, a physician may perform a pelvic exam, check for any STDs, and provide information and education about women’s health issues. A physician may also order tests, such as a pelvic ultrasound, to evaluate your reproductive system.

China has been at the forefront of this technological advancement, with the country’s researchers having published numerous studies on the use of AI in medicine in reputable scientific journals. One study from 2018, for example, discussed the use of AI in the diagnosis of biliary atresia, a condition in which the bile ducts are unable to communicate with the small intestine.

The study described an AI system that could analyze images of the liver and gallbladder, and detect features associated with biliary atresia, such as the presence of bile plugs and the absence of bile ducts. The system could also give physicians information on the location of bile ducts that were not visible in images.

Plain radiographs, CT, and MRI have long been used to assess brain injuries. However, they fail to accurately assess the extent of mild TBI because the early changes in brain structure that occur after mild TBI are not visually apparent on conventional imaging. That is where MRI comes in. MRI is more sensitive than plain radiographs and CT in detecting mild TBI. It can also distinguish between the various types of mild TBI. However, despite its advantages, MRI is not without its share of problems. One of the problems is cost. MRI machines are expensive and access to them can be limited. Another problem is the shortage of radiologists. With the increasing use of MRI, the demand for radiologists has increased at a rate that cannot keep up with the supply. This shortage is exacerbated by the fact that many radiologists are","Matching patient symptoms with potential diagnoses in EHR is done by the
Reasoner. The Reasoner uses a set of rules to make its best guess as to what diagnosis is most likely given a set of observed symptoms.  These rules are created by the knowledge base of the system.  The system can be taught, by the user, to recognize additional symptom patterns.  For example, the system may be taught to recognize ""asthma"" by having the user enter in some instances of asthma attacks.  The system can also learn by itself, over time, by observing the symptoms associated with asthma attacks.  The more the system is taught and the more it learns, the better it gets at matching symptoms to diagnoses.","Matching patient symptoms with potential diagnoses in EHR

A standard mammogram includes craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views of both breasts.  Abnormalities are classified using a standardized system.  A true screening mammogram is defined as one that is interpreted by a properly trained and certified mammographer.  A diagnostic mammogram is performed when a mammographer suspects an abnormality.
