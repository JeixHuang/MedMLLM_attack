I can try to help identify possible health conditions based on the symptoms you describe, but it's important to remember that I'm not a doctor. My ability to suggest possible diagnoses will be based on general medical knowledge, and I cannot confirm any specific condition. For an accurate diagnosis, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional who can offer a comprehensive assessment, including physical examinations and necessary tests. If you want, you can describe the symptoms and show the similar image, and I'll do my best to provide relevant information.
