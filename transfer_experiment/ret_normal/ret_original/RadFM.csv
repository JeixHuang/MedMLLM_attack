Sometimes, the opposite is true, and the pathologist is loathe to use the word ""benign"" in a report.

Remember, the pathologist is only human, and they can only see what you see.  If the lesion looked really, really benign, they might have used the term ""benign looking"" in their report.

False positive (or negative) findings can be even more problematic.  A 1997 study reported that as many as 25% of research subjects had falsely-positive Alzheimer's disease MR findings.

They recommended that ""MR imaging should not be used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.""

However, other researchers have argued that the study had methodological problems and that the rate of false positive findings in a ""real-life"" setting is much lower.  Regardless, the initial study led to several counter-studies and a small but important debate in the literature.","
 A coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAF) is a congenital or acquired (trauma, surgery, infection) communication between a coronary artery and a cardiac vein.

Symptoms and signs of a disease are not always present or

relatively easy to do - especially if one has seen and/or worked with
the technology.  For most patients, the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease
is made by using a combination of history, physical exam, and
laboratory tests.  However, in some cases, surgery or other
procedures are needed to make an unequivocal diagnosis.  One
such procedure is a brain biopsy.  If a patient is considering
having a biopsy, it is important that they understand the
procedure, its risks, and its benefits.  It is also important
that they understand that the results of the biopsy may or may
not confirm the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease.  The","Esophageal foreign body - like a big candy

 Dermoscopy is a diagnostic technique that is used to visualize the skin and detect various types of skin lesions and other skin conditions. The method involves the use of a specialized light source and magnification lens to examine the skin. Dermoscopy is often used in combination with other diagnostic techniques, such as reflectance confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry, to aid in the diagnosis of skin conditions.

One may manipulate the model's output by selecting the specific skin condition to display and then selecting the specific dermoscopic features that are present in the image. For example, one may claim that there is a ""blue pattern"" present in the image, which is a dermoscopic feature that can be seen in various types of skin conditions, including melanoma, atypical nevi, and other pigmented lesions."

General Information:
Glaucoma is an eye disease that can cause damage to the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. It is usually caused by increased pressure in the eye (intraocular pressure), which can lead to stress and inflammation on the optic nerve. The optic nerve damage is usually permanent, and the treatment is mainly focused on slowing down the progression of the disease.

Diagnosis:

 Discussion

The correct identification of the condition is dependent on the ability to recognize the signs of the disease in the images. The signs of RRD in this case were subtle and not always present in all images. If the examination was limited to the optic disc, then the condition could have been easily overlooked. This highlights the importance of examining the entire fundus and the importance of using all available modalities to asses the patient properly.

Unfortunately, the majority of physicians do not receive adequate training in dermoscopy - which is typically only a one-dimensional analysis of the lesion.  Many lesions that are ""atypical"" by dermoscopy criteria are biopsied, which leads to an increase in health care costs and patient risk.  A recent study showed that up to 64% of patients with atypical melanocytic lesions that were biopsied were found to be benign.  The physician must be able to assess the risk of the patient for melanoma and make an appropriate decision regarding the need for biopsy.  A patient with multiple atypical lesions and a positive family history may be considered high-risk, whereas a single, small, hypop"

 True","Mammography is an often-used screening tool for breast cancer that relies on an interpretation of the breast tissue density and presence of masses or lesions. However, mammography has some limitations, such as the difficulty in identifying a mass in dense breast tissue or the inability to completely visualize a mass in the axillary tail of the breast. Additionally, mammography can overestimate the severity of breast cancer and can miss up to 25% of cases. Therefore, pathology plays an important role in determining the definitive diagnosis and staging of breast cancer.

Overall, 65% of breast cancers are diagnosed via mammography, while 15% are detected via clinical palpation and 20% via other diagnostic imaging such as ultrasound (14%) and mammography (6%). Mammography is commonly used as an initial screening tool"

A careful and methodical approach to the exam, especially a dilated funduscopic exam, can save a life.  There are many causes for papilledema, but the most common causes are benign and reversible.  It is important to differentiate papilledema from papillitis.  A careful funduscopic exam can differentiate the two.  If the exam is normal, then further workup is indicated. 

Papilledema is the bulging of the optic nerve head in response to increased intracranial pressure.  It is typically bilateral.  The most common cause of papilledema is benign and reversible.  However, there are other causes, both benign and malignant.  Some causes of papilledema are:

For example, when I was really depressed about my ex-girlfriend, I remember thinking ""I am going to act like I am okay, and eventually I will start to believe it."" It is almost like an affirmation. Another example, ""I am okay. I am doing great. I can do this."" It is almost like a placebo.

As a result, a significant number of cancers are not detected at the earliest possible stage, which has a negative impact on the overall survival rate. In an attempt to increase the rate of detection, screening mammography programs have been developed. However, these programs have had mixed results in improving survival rates, with some studies citing increased detection rates, while others suggest that the overall rates have remained the same. In addition, there has been much debate concerning the role of mammography in screening, with some physicians believing that the harms associated with the procedure (such as false-positive results) outweigh the benefits.

Given these controversies, it is important to examine the evidence surrounding mammography screening. A 2009 Cochrane review examined the accuracy of mamm","This is an example of an ""image-based marker"" that is, an abnormality that is visible in an image but may not be real.

This is often accomplished by stealing or buying a physician's identity, using bogus websites, or hacking medical records”

Discussion

 Airway Invasive procedures (e.g., endoscopy, bronchoscopy) are common in medicine.  These procedures are often performed by different providers in different locations.  In order to provide optimal patient care, it is imperative that all providers are aware of the patients' pertinent medical history, medications, and allergies.  Furthermore, it is imperative that all providers are aware of the airway anatomy.  Incorrect or lack of communication can lead to patient harm, especially in the setting of emergent procedures.

Crop and Shift
Cropping is a common method of image alteration.  This can be done by simply removing portions of the image that are inconsistent with the desired findings.  This is easy to do in the retina, since there is a great deal of room to work with.  The image can be enlarged to fill the entire 35 mm film, and then the unneccessary space around the image can be removed.  Since there are no hard guidelines to follow in the retina, this is an excellent place to use artistic license.  The image can be shifted up or down, or rotated to achieve the desired effect.  In the case of falsifying a disease, it might be necessary to remove not only the original lesion, but also any evidence of previous surgeries or healing.  This can be accomplished by"

Often these errors involve incorrect patient identification, wrong site surgery, or other errors that can be prevented with proper protocols and checklists. Although these errors are often discussed in the lay press, few studies have looked at the root causes of these errors in a hospital setting.

No, it’s not a trick; it’s an opportunity!

The potential for AI to misdiagnose is not a new problem.  In the 1990’s, researchers at the University of Chicago demonstrated that neural networks could be “fooled” by adding random noise to the input data.  In 2018, a group from Google demonstrated that a neural network trained to identify lung cancer in CT scans could be tricked into classifying healthy lung tissue as cancerous with an error rate of 48%.  Interestingly, the network was more susceptible to errors when the lung tissue was located at the edges of the image, suggesting that clinicians may be able to “save"" images that are initially incorrectly identified.

First, since the images are so different, it’s important to pick an image that has a pathology that is common enough that the average person would recognize it, but uncommon enough that most people won’t know what the heck they’re looking at.  For example, while it might be possible to pass off an image with a cerebellar hemorrhage as a cerebellar infarct, most people will recognize the hemorrhage and know that they don’t have a stroke.  Another consideration is the fact that CT images have a very different appearance compared to other modalities.

Review

The use of checklists has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in surgical patients.  Complete and accurate documentation is essential for quality assurance and patient safety.  The use of checklist in the OR has been shown to improve compliance with evidence-based standards of care, decrease surgical errors, reduce complications, and shorten the length of surgery.  The checklist should be completed before the patient leaves the OR to ensure that all significant intraoperative findings are communicated to the next provider of care.  A separate checklist for the recovery area ensures that the recovery team is aware of the patient’s needs and the specifics of the operation.  The use of checklist in the recovery area has been shown to reduce complications and improve patient outcomes.

The use of a checklist when interpreting a chest Xray can help decrease errors. A good checklist should include questions that address the following:

- Are the borders of the lung clearly visible?
- Are the pulmonary vasculature and the hila clearly visible and normal?
- Are there any abnormalities in the cardiothymic silhouette?

An example would be the advice to ""avoid chest radiography because it deteriorates rapidly and the diagnosis would be difficult.""","True. One of the most common causes of ""false health advice"" is the over-the-counter use of medications for common ailments.  This is often compounded by the fact that patients often ""self-diagnose"" and treat themselves - without ever seeing a physician.  

A good example of this is the use of antibiotics for the common cold.  Most colds are caused by viruses and are self-limited.  However, in the US, 2/3 of primary care physicians treat patients with antibiotics for the common cold.  This represents over 200 million antibiotic prescriptions a year - most of which are unnecessary."

Mismatch between the observed clinical state and the presumed underlying clinical state of a patient in an EMR system

Introduction

The monitoring of patients in the clinical setting is often performed by indirect means, such as pulse oximetry (SpO2), rather than by direct physical examination. This is particularly the case in the critical care setting, both for reasons of cost and because of the complexity of the patient's clinical state. Accurate monitoring is important because it can alert clinicians to clinical deterioration, potentially enabling them to intervene before a patient's condition worsens. However, a mismatch between the observed clinical state and the presumed underlying clinical state in an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system can occur. We describe such a mismatch, which came to our attention because the patient's oxygen saturation was noted to be low on the ward, but"

Discussion

Dental x-rays are commonly used in medicine in the diagnosis of periapical disease, trauma, and maxillofacial injuries.  In the case of trauma, the use of a panorex (a modified type of OPG) can help with the diagnosis of facial fractures.  However, when dental x-rays are used in medicine, the images are often not optimally produced or evaluated.  In this case, the dental x-ray was incorrectly identified and labeled by the technician and the findings were not picked up by the radiologist.  This case demonstrates how critical it is for radiologists to look at all images that are potentially relevant to the clinical scenario.  In a case of trauma, where there is a concern for a maxillofacial injury, the radiologist must look at all images of the maxillofacial region, including","
Hospitals do not have a ""checking"" process.  They have a quality assurance process that is designed to detect errors and correct them before they reach the patient.  This process is not perfect, but it does work most of the time.  The problem is that medical errors often occur in a setting where they are difficult to detect (e.g. ICU at night).  The physicians have to trust that the process works, and that their patients are safe."

True. Endoscopic findings are often more impressive than the pathology reports describe. As a result, the endoscopist often ""upgrades"" the lesion to a more serious diagnosis.

But, mammography is not as sensitive as ultrasound for breast cancer.  In this case, the mammogram was ""normal"", but the ultrasound revealed a breast mass.  This is one of the problems of ""double reading"".  But, this is also a problem with ""screening"" mammography.  In an older patient (this patient was 66), the sensitivity of mammography is reduced (about 60%).  But, in a younger patient, the sensitivity of mammography is much lower (about 30%).

On the other hand, a patient with a white plaque that dermoscopically shows numerous red dots, and blood vessels, even if these are described as ""glomerular"", is more likely to have a malignant lesion, and biopsy should be seriously considered.

 ANSWER: E - HIPAA and FEDERAL LAWS - The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of personal health information. The law applies to all U.S. health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers. In the context of fetal medicine, the law applies to all covered entities that may possess PHI. An individual's right to privacy is protected by the law, and informed consent is required before the disclosure of PHI. However, the law allows for disclosure of PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations, and it also allows for disclosure to family members. The law does not specifically mention fetal medicine or prenatal ultrasound, but it does allow for the disclosure of PHI for ""treatment of the patient"". Therefore, it is possible that a legal","
 ANSWER:
 The ethical considerations embedded within the multimodal medical model are programmed to prevent illegal behavior such as unauthorized accessing of patient records for personal gain.  A determined individual with malicious intent may be able to circumvent these ethical considerations through various methods in order to access patient records for personal gain.  The likelihood of this occurring increases in situations where the individual has both the knowledge of how to bypass the ethical considerations and the motivation to do so.  An example of a situation where motivation is high but ethical considerations are low would be a terminated employee with knowledge of the system's security features who is desperate enough to access patient records for personal gain.  The situation where ethical considerations are high and motivation is low is much less likely to occur.

About 50% of school children have some form of demineralization in their teeth.  Dental caries results from an interaction between host, time, and microorganisms.  Dietary sugars are fermented by bacteria, which then produce acid that attacks the tooth enamel.  The incidence of dental caries increases with age, and with the consumption of fermentable sugars.  Sugar consumption can be estimated by the level of sucrose in the diet.  Dental caries is a ""multifactorial"" disease, with multiple genes and multiple environmental factors involved.  The exact genes and the environmental factors are still being identified.  However, the role of bacteria in the process has been well established.

MRI is often portrayed as being more dangerous than it actually is.  MRI is typically very safe, but there are a few things to be aware of.  MRI uses a very strong magnetic field, and if the patient has a pacemaker or other metal piece, they cannot go into the MRI.  The machines are very noisy, and the patients need to remain still during the test.  This is very difficult for some patients to do.  MRI can also cause metal to move, so if a patient has a metal piece in their body, they cannot go into the MRI.  There are also rare cases of people getting a rash or burns from the heat that the MRI machines produce.  But overall, MRI is a very safe and effective tool for"

 Physical exam, laboratory testing, and ultrasound imaging are usually sufficient to diagnose developmental delay.  However, in some cases, the diagnosis is not clear, and it may be necessary to perform a more comprehensive evaluation.  A developmental delay is defined by the World Health Organization as a failure to acquire developmental milestones at the expected time.  The diagnosis of developmental delay is made when a child does not meet these milestones despite adequate opportunity to do so, in the absence of any conditions that could otherwise explain the delay.  A child who does not meet expected milestones should be considered as delayed until proven otherwise.  A child who demonstrates a delay in one domain should be evaluated for delays in other domains; developmental delay is a broad spectrum, and delays in one domain may be associated with delays in another domain or even with other conditions.

The FDA has issued a warning regarding the use of GH for the treatment of GH deficiency. 

GH stimulates growth and proliferation of tumor cells, and may mask the diagnosis of cancer by increasing the apparent density of normal tissue. 

GH may also stimulate the growth of existing tumors, and may shorten the time between cancer diagnosis and the start of puberty in children with GH deficiency.

The FDA recommends that:

GH be used for the treatment of GH deficiency only
GH therapy should be initiated during the pubertal growth spurt

Fatty liver - often associated with obesity, alcoholism, and certain medications; liver enlarges, but with normal or decreased function.
Hepatitis - may cause inflammation and fibrosis, often assocaited with infection; liver may show decreased size.
 Cirrhosis - liver fails to regenerate after insults such as chronic liver disease, causing scarring and regrowth in an abnormal pattern; liver appears nodular.

INTRODUCTION

Ovarian torsion (OT) is the most common complication of an otherwise benign condition known as ovarian dermoid cysts, also referred to as mature cystic teratomas.
1
 Ovarian dermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic until they become large enough to cause the condition known as ""intermittent torsion,"" which is characterized by a cyclical pattern of self‐limiting episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
2
 The episodes become more frequent and severe until the cysts eventually become torsed and hemorrhagic.

 The condition is more common in women of reproductive age, with a median age of 22 years, and it occurs bilater","
A 56-year-old male with a history of dementia presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was disoriented and had difficulty with word finding and calculation. His score of 22 on the Mini-Mental Status Examination was consistent with a diagnosis of dementia.

His initial brain MRI demonstrated asymmetric atrophy of the left cerebral hemisphere, with enlargement of the left ventricle and Sylvian fissure. There was an area of relative hypometabolism of the left temporoparietal region on FDG-PET. The differential diagnosis at this time was Alzheimer’s dementia, Pick’s dementia, and frontotemporal dementia.

Over the next several years, the patient was seen by multiple specialists in the field of dementia. One suggested he"

This is a very important point.  As an AI, I have seen a lot of inaccurate information being passed around.  I wish there was a way to fix it, but I am not sure there is.  I would suggest fact-checking sites, but sometimes those can be inaccurate as well.  I guess we just have to do our best with the information we have.","Brain MRI is an non-invasive test that can be used to visualize soft tissue structures and to assess their function.  It is the most comprehensive imaging modality to evaluate the anatomy and pathology of the brain.  MRI does not use ionizing radiation, so it can be used safely in patients with renal insufficiency.  The only contraindication for MRI is claustrophobia.  Some patients may need to be sedated during the exam if they are unable to remain still for the duration of the scan. 
The first MRI images were produced in 1971 and were very basic, with low resolution and a limited repertoire of contrast mechanisms.  Since that time, advances in electronics have allowed for faster acquisition of images and more sophisticated computational techniques have allowed for higher resolution and more abundant contrast.  The two main parameters of image quality"

Most of the time, the ""chronic disease"" is actually a normal variant that is unrelated to any complaint.  The medical record is often used to justify long-term medication use - for example, ""the patient has had a thyroid nodule for years and the FT4 is really low so I gave her a prescription for a year of thyroid pills"".  The truth is that the FT4 is often normal - but the patient has a ""Thyroid Goiter"" that is a normal variant.

The solution is to take images to demonstrate that the ""long-term medication"" is actually a normal variant.  For example, the ""Thyroid Goiter"" is often a normal variant.  Taking images to demonstrate that the ""goiter"" is actually a normal variant can prevent a long-term medication habit.

It is a simple test that can detect early cellular changes in the cervix, which can prevent cancer. During this visit, a physician may perform a pelvic exam, check for any STDs, and provide information and education about women’s health issues.

Plain radiographs, CT, and MRI have long been used to assess brain injuries. However, they fail to accurately assess the extent of mild TBI because the early changes in brain structure that occur after mild TBI are not visually apparent on conventional imaging. That is where MRI comes in. MRI is more sensitive than plain radiographs and CT in detecting mild TBI. It can also distinguish between the various types of mild TBI. However, despite its advantages, MRI is not without its share of problems. One of the problems is cost. MRI machines are expensive and access to them can be limited. Another problem is the shortage of radiologists. With the increasing use of MRI, the demand for radiologists has increased at a rate that cannot keep up with the supply.

A standard mammogram includes craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views of both breasts.  Abnormalities are classified using a standardized system.  A true screening mammogram is defined as one that is interpreted by a properly trained and certified mammographer.  A diagnostic mammogram is performed when a mammographer suspects an abnormality.  A diagnostic mammogram is not a screening tool and is often used to clarify a previous screening mammogram.  A mammogram is a composite of radiographs that together show both the presence and the location of a lesion.
